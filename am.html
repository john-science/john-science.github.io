<h4><span id=".22Demon_Friend.22.2C_in_which_you_were_tricked_by_hungry_demons..C2.A0.28Quest_level_5.29">"Demon Friend", in which you were tricked by hungry demons.&#160;(Quest level 5)</span></h4>

<pre>
First, gather the following items:

A sea shell found by searching inside the conch shop on Cockbill Street.
A cauldron, found by searching inside the house east of Rimward Gate, after getting rid of the lady inhabiting it.
The black frisbee for sale in the T-shop or from the Foreign Ambassadors' Reception in Djelibeybi.
A crystal ladle, for sale in the general shop on Vagabond Street.
A giant coin, which is in fact the table in the money changers on the Street of Bookkeepers (This is heavy, if you cannot pick it up, drag it).
A strange angler fish, found by searching outside the Fishermen's Guild (This will decay so it's worth getting it last, along with the toadstools).
Four large toadstools, found growing on the Tump (This will decay so it's worth getting it last, along with the angler fish).

The cauldron must be filled with water from the Ankh, either by entering the liquid parts of the river within the city,
or by digging in the solid parts of it with a shovel and filling it with the water that bubbles up.

Take all of the items into the room outside of the Least Gate (Eastern most Ankh gate) that mentions a clearning,
drop them all except the shell, then "blow" into the shell.

<h4><span id=".22Doppleganger.22.2C_in_which_you_recognised_locals_from_afar..C2.A0.28Quest_level_4.29">"Doppleganger", in which you recognised locals from afar.&#160;(Quest level 4)</span></h4>

<pre>
There are unique, named NPCs wandering around AM that have names that are current or former creator names in reverse.
Say the creator name (usually the reversed name of the NPC) in the same room with them - e.g.
for Mota 'say atom'. Presto's NPC is Notserp (but say Presto).
It might not be required to find all of them.

The dopplegangers are:

    Adnew, Alab Nad, Analla, Anarual, Ahtued, Dyffat, Eki Rhs, Endaira, Enim Rac, Euq, Eur, Hsif K'nip,
    Ilik, Kelsej, Mota, Nacirrut, Naiu Q Sad, Nadow, Nmad'ho, Notserp (say "Presto"),
    Nyvven, Repurg, Retlobgod, Sebboh, Serec, Sokkard, Sssld, Suoiruc, Y Llit

The required subset for the quest is likely:

    Adnew, Anarual, Endaira, Euq, Eur, Hsif K'nip, Kelsej, Mota, Nacirrut, Nmad'ho, Notserp/Presto and Nyvven

that is, the original twelve quest dopples, before Dogbolter started expanding them in the early '00s.

<h4><span id=".22Executive_Chatter.22.2C_in_which_you_got_ripped_off_by_a_telepathic_imp..C2.A0.28Quest_level_3.29">"Executive Chatter", in which you got ripped off by a telepathic imp.&#160;(Quest level 3)</span></h4>

<pre>
<b>Skills:</b> Guild Level 150
<b>Items:</b> 15 royals
Find the Greedy Imp who wanders around AM.
DO NOT GIVE HIM THE MONEY.
Follow him or he'll walk off after a few seconds.
Say "fifteen", and ask about his exclusive club and the the fee for joining.
Say "know what I mean?" and then "wink" at him the way he winked at you.
You will get the quest when he swipe your royals immediately after you winked and you'll have access to talker channels A'Tuin &amp; Intermud.

<h4><span id=".22Sign_Reader.22.2C_in_which_you_followed_the_signs_in_order_to_return_some_stolen_property...C2.A0.28Quest_level_3.29">"Sign Reader", in which you  followed the signs in order to return some stolen property..&#160;(Quest level 3)</span></h4>

<pre>
<b>Skills:</b> 25 levels adventuring.movement.climbing.rock to stay on the stepladder (118 bonus or less)
<b>Items:</b> crowbar, stepladder (in the basement of the Post Office)
Outside the main entrance of the post office there is a notice which misses letters.
They have been "repurposed" to create (street) signs elsewhere in Ankh-Morpork.
If there is a street sign, the room description (verbose as well as brief) ends with "a bronze sign is fixed to the wall."
Known location of the street signs are:
* The east end of <b>Filigree Street</b> (North of Assassins Guild)
* The south end of <b>Upper Broadway</b>
* The east end of <b>God Street</b>
* (The east end of) <b>Grunefair</b>
* The north end of <b>King's Way</b> (at the King's Way Rathskeller)
* (The northwest end of) <b>Quarry lane</b> (southeast of Sticken Place)
* (The northeast end of) <b>Merchants Street</b>
* (The east end of) <b>Zephire Street</b> (west of Dolly Sisters)
Use the crowbar to "pry" the letters off.
Having recovered the letters go back to the post office and "set up" the stepladder you will find in the basement to "replace" the letters on the notice.
The notice will read now: NEITHER RAIN NOR SNOW NOR GLOOM OF NIGHT CAN STAY THESE MESSENGERS ABOUT THEIR DUTY.

<pre>
<b>Items:</b> 5 watermelons (fruit shop on Baker Street, or free outside Djelibeybi during the right season), or 2 dead eels from Little Agatea and a knife
Find Louis Bingham as he wanders AM.
Keep cutting the food until they're too small to cut further, then give one piece at a time to Louis.
Wait until he's finished one before giving him the next.
This is based on number of food items, not on weight or value, and you need to give him at least 50.
Eventually he'll explode.
Note: It may be that you need to use "fresh" food, 64 cured sixteenths of a dead eel did not get the quest.
The number of items fed seems to carry over for some time, so you can make multiple visits many days apart and still get the quest
 - gave up after a while and two weeks later fed one more 16th of melon and he exploded!

Go to the dead end room at the southeast end of The Willows and "climb down".
"search" again to find a hole in the boat and go down - if this doesn't work, 'look at boards' and then 'move boards' to reveal the hole.
Kill the crocodile (not a wimpy beast, if too hard just go "up"), "search" once more to find the rusty chainmail, and polish it.

First, go to the job shop on Cheap Street and "apply for a job".
Keeble will give you an envelope, which you then give to the Splatter outside the
All Bar None tavern on the southeast corner of Pseudopolis Yard, or do the DRESSED UP TO THE NINES quest first.
He's only there at night, and if you portal in during the day you'll be automatically kicked out.
Give the envelope to Thom Crooze once you're inside, and he'll tell you what drink to mix first and a shaker and glass.
You can "research" the drink to see what the ingredients are.
Then you should pour the ingredients into the shaker until they're mixed together to form the request drink with nothing else left over.
A good way to find the ratios is by pouring small-ish quantities of the ingredients, then adding drops until you get the desired result.
Next CLOSE the shaker, and "shake shaker".
Open the shaker and pour it into a glass, then give the glass to Thom.
He'll have you make a total of three drinks.
If you don't remember what drink you requested to mix, ask Thom: 'could you please remind me?'.
If you lost the shaker, ask Thom a new one.

Tip: when you use small amounts of the different ingredients, you can use a teat pipette to suck out the superfluous drops (which didn't mix into the requested drink) after shaking.

Go to the Dysk Theatre and buy tickets or a season's pass.
I suggest staying with the cheap tickets unless you have cash to burn.
When the curtain falls at the end, "applaud the play" or "boo the play".

You need about 30% of the maxmium possible quest points to do this quest (currently 200), and a decent amount of money.
Go to Number One on the north side of Pseudpolis yard, and head upstairs.
You'll need to get your nails and hair done ($60-$100?), and buy clothing in the building as well.
Even if you're female, male clothing is sufficient, and preferable due to costing far less and being ready far faster than the dresses.
Go up another floor and buy a pair of dress trousers, a ruffled dress shirt, a dinner jacket, and a bow tie ($87.50 total--thieves can try to shoplift these items instead).
Put your weapons in a container or vault them, and wander over to the All Bar None tavern on the southeast corner of Pseudopolis Yard at night time.
DO NOT FIGHT OR GET WET after having nails and hair done because they will be ruined and you'll have to do them over.
Say to the splatter that you are famous, then say that you know Thom Crooze if he asks who you know that's on the list.

If you do choose to get the dress, you may end up paying much more ($250?), you will be given an
appointment time to be fitted for a dress, and then you will have to wait until the dress is finished
(and pick the dress up within seven days of it being completed.)
The dress is not sufficient clothing to complete the quest, but a dress and a boa is.

<b>Skills:</b> 100 crafts.culinary.baking bonus absolute minimum to ever succeed.
You need: 10+ dried frog powder (apothecary on Prouts just north of Apothecary Gardens)
Go to Argle's bakery on the south end of Baker Street and "apply for a job".
Argle will list possible values for each of a couple ingredients twice, but you can get more possible values by saying "instructions" a few times.
Go south into the kitchen.
Write down those values he listed (usually 3 or 4 scoops flour, 1 or 2 pourings of water,
1 or 2 pinches of salt, variable amount of goo, and always just 1 pinch dried frog).

The commands are:
scoop flour into stove
pour water from sink into stove (you may need to "pump water into sink" first)
pour goo into stove
sprinkle salt in stove
place frog in stove
pull lever on stove

Repeat each ingredient depending on how much of each you want in the recipe, using Argle's suggestions as a starting point.
You can make this task easy for yourself by drawing up a table on paper of each of your tries and the results yes, be scientific.
Take heed of what comes out of the oven because say if it "lacks bulk" you need more flour, if it's dry or brittle you need more water, if it has salt crystals you need less salt.
If it has been "inexpertly baked" you failed the skill check so you need to try again with the same ingredients until you pass the skill check (it's a bit random).
It is a good idea to bury the stuff that comes out of the stove as soon as you've examined it so you don't get confused.
Keep going, doing a guess and check routine based on your table and when you get bread, go north and give it to the baker.
You receive AM$10 when quest is complete.
Too much flour: It looks quite bulky.
Too much salt: You can see salt crystals on it.
Too little flour: It looks a bit thin though as if it's missing some bulk.
Too little goo: It is crumbling a little.
Too much water: no message (but not a "loaf of bread" yet either)

<b>Skills:</b> 180+ bonus in crafts.arts.calligraphy.
<b>Items:</b> pieces of paper to write on (chapbook pages, odds and ends on east side of Plaza of Broken Moons).
Go to the Salt Shaker on the southeast end of Upper Broadway, near the Pepper Pot.
In the ground level flat is a family of Agateans.
The children have the Agatean words for the numbers one through ten as names.
While speaking Agatean, say the corresponding number to four different children (ie - "sayto ichi one").
The fourth child should then ask you (in Agatean) to write his or her name.
Write the word for that number (ie - "one", without quotes) in Agatean on a piece of paper using the
calligraphy brush and inkwell from the bedroom to the north.
If the calligraphy is neat ("simple", "neat", etc) enough, give the paper to the child to get the quest.
Failing the written or calligraphy skill check may both display the same failure message.

Ichi - one
Ni - two
San - three
Shi - four
Go - five
Roku - six
Nana - seven
Hachi - eight
Kyuu - nine
Zyuu - ten

You can simply say different numbers to each child until you get it right.
The first three children may or may not let you know when you have gotten their names right; there is no penalty for continuing to say numbers to the child, though.

<b>Reqs:</b> Completion of the Keen Observer quest, and greater than 200 bonus for ad.perception is needed: minimum levels require further research.

Locate the underground areas below the Dolly Sisters Watch House.
From the dusty attic where you end up after, move the bed.
You need to pass a perception skill (min level?) check in order to move it.
Take a look at the helmets, pushing them over.
This brings you down into the underground where there is no way out other than completing the quest.
Go to the far end of the underground corridor to a large hall with a deep hole with copper bar in it.
Hold on to the bar tight (if it's not tight you'll fall off!), and jump down the hole.
Jumping down the whole without holding on tight is rather painful (ca 1500 hp loss).
If you are holding on tight, you'll slide down the bar and get the quest.

First you need to find the Rose Seller.
This is easiest during the day time when he's at his house on the northwest end of Washer Way.
At night he wanders around selling roses at taverns and restaurants.
Say something about "special roses" and he'll give you some seeds.
You may want to say it again to get more seeds now, instead of tracking him down later.
Go to the greenhouse attached to his house and "search" the boxes repeatedly until it says there's no interesting packets left.
Keep the packets in the room (don't bury).

The colour of fertiliser you need depends on the fullness of the rose he wants.
The effect of the fertiliser on the fullness (very single, single, semi-double, double, very double, extreme double) changes with every person.
The colours are Black, Brown, Green, Grey, Ochre and Yellow.

The texture of the fertiliser determines how thorny (unarmed, somewhat thorny, thorny, quite thorny, very thorny, armed, viciously thorny),
however which texture produces which thorns is also random for each person doing the quest.
The textures are Coarse, Fine, Glittery, Grainy, Powdery, Rough and Soft.

"Plant" the seed in a pot, then "fertilise my planted rose" with the appropriate colour of fertiliser,
then "fill" the watering can from the tap and "water my planted rose".
After being watered, it takes about 5 minutes (RW) to see the whay type of rose has grown.
Look at the pot periodically and eventually the rose will grow and it won't say that it's recently been watered,
meaning it's time to water again, depending on the rose size you need.
Each watering will make the rose grow bigger.

If it's got the wrong fullness or amount of thorns, pluck it ("pluck my rose") and start again with a different fertiliser colour or texture.
There are 6 colours but 7 texture options that can be every combination for the fertiliser.

When it's the right size, "pluck" your rose and give it to the rose seller.
It will probably take quite a few visits to find the right texture, hence the extra seeds will probably be needed.
Keep searching intermittently when you can.

<b>Items:</b> lemons, a few at a time or pickle them (fruit shop on baker street, fruit stall in Djelibeybi bazaar,

<b>Items:</b> rat corpses (search streets, plenty on sold part of Ankh River, or kill a few at a time
       in Rattigan's house on Contact Walk, or the Pepper Pot located near the intersection of Upper Broadway and Endless Street)

The first thing to do is go to the Alchemists' Guild on Street of Alchemists.
On the first floor above ground level is a classroom with Bradley Weiss in it.
Say "regurgitator" to get instructions, then "search shelves" repeatedly, but don't go AFK or anything because cockroaches sometimes crawl out of the shelves and into your ears.
Ugh.
You can dodge them, but if they find their way into your ears, "shake" a few times and kill the roaches before they crawl back in.
 You also might get hit with spilled acid when you search, but you can dodge this with decent bonus.

Keep searching until you basically have vials filled with acids that are at least 10 different colours.
 Store them in a useful pack or satchel, then go get a few lemons and rat corpses from a source listed above.
For the first few attempts, Bradley will tell you to use specific acid colours, so do as he says.
 They won't succeed of course, but you have to go through the motions for this quest.

The commands are:
 attach corpse to harness
 attach lemon to apparatus
 pour vial into dish
 flick switch
After doing the acids Bradley lists, you'll need to do another five or so to get the quest.
 At some point in the process, a giant rat dog might appear, and either try to eat you or become your pet.

 5) an ore, available from the shop on the ground floor of the Alchemists' Guild
 6) an acid, available from the shelves one floor down in Bradley's classroom.
 He won't say the acid colour, but call it by its proper name.
 So you need to go to the library nearby in the Guild and "research" until you find a scrap of paper that indicates the acid colour for that substance.
 If he asks for nitrate, you'll need bat guano from a pooping fruitbat, and batsup from the acid shelves.
 Then use the nitrolator in the Guild to form nitrate out of them.
 7) a vial of something available by searching the storage closet nearby in the Guild
 8) Various amounts of gold coins, either Rhinu or from a money changer.
 This might be $100-$200 worth, taking exchange rates into account.

Give him each item as he asks for it, to get him to ask for the next.
 After giving him the gold, he'll either turn it into more gold or platinum coins, or give you fewer coins than you gave him.

Lerd Ors in the Coin Pitt has lost a rare coin from his collection and wants you to help look for it.
 From outside the Coin Pitt, head southeast then south to an abandoned house and then down to enter the cellar.
 In the cellar, "search pool" will yield a slimy coin (if you don't find the coin, your perception is too low).
The coin must then be cleaned using a cleaning tray from Coin Corner and some acid which can be found by searching various shelves in the Alchemist's Guild ("pour vial into tray", "clean slimy coin with tray").
When the coin is cleaned, it can be returned to Lerd Ors.

<pre>
Official info:
"<i>Go to the labratory on the top floor of the Alchemists' Guild, in the room with the amalgamator and Two-Fingers McKluskey.
Pull six levers, then push the button to start a chemical reaction.
Pay attention to the results to determine how close your combination of chemicals is to what is required to blow up the guild.
A bigger explosion means you have more chemicals in the proper order relative to each other.
The quantities that are dispensed by one pull of a lever isn’t enough to cause a reaction by itself, but that might change with larger quantities.
Any chemicals that don't react with their current neighbours during a reaction may cause adverse side effects.
To find out which effects are produced by which chemicals, research in the Alchemists' Guild library.
Each chemical only reacts with the chemicals immediately above or below it, hence order of chemicals relative to each other is essential.
Multiple explosions can also result, when appropriate.</i>"

Walkthrough:
Go the room with the Central Amalgamator up two flights of stairs in the Alchemists' Guild.
 The combination is reset every time the building explodes, and no one gets their own unique combo.
So 2 people working on it at the same time are working toward the same combo.
 The combination doesn't seem to reset if the building explodes of its own accord.

So, 10 levers in the room, 6 levers must be pulled with each attempt.
Every time you pull 6 levers then hit the big button, you will get two types of results.
The first is one or more explosions (or lack thereof) of chemicals in the right order relative to each other, and the second is the side effect from one of the chemicals you selected.

The side effects are annoying and slow things down a bit, but don't really help to figure out the combination.
To minimize damage and delay, don't wear clothes if possible (one of the effects mimics the Searing Touch ritual) and bring healing tea.
 If you're quick, and leave the room before or <i>immediately</i> after the text that shows the side effect, you can avoid getting hit by it.

Some of the effects are: Something similar to Searing Touch; the effect one gets from eating fruitbat poop; turning colours; noxious gas that remains in the room for a little while, causing anyone there to choke periodically; blindness; sickness (doesn't harm); hallucinations; not noticing people in rooms.
Be careful about Searing Touch and noxious gas.
You can leave the room before side effects appear, but Two-fingers McKluskey (NPC who configures the machine) can't, and he'll get damaged.
It's possible that he can die, so watch his health and heal him as needed.

The little explosions tell you how many chemicals you have in the right order, and if you have more than 1 set of chemicals in the right order.
The explosion messages are:

No combination of chemicals are in the right order:
<b>A small puff of smoke comes from the ingredients in the central cylinder.
The watching students laugh at you.</b>

One pair of chemicals in the right order:
<b>There is a brief low-level flash and a few puffs of smoke from the ingredients in the cylinder.</b>
The students snigger at you.

One triplet of chemicals in the right order:
<b>There is a small flash of light and a small cloud of smoke rises from the ingredients in the cylinder.</b>
The students look as if they are about to run, but then merely look nonchalant as they realise nothing is going to happen.

One quadruplet of chemicals in the right order:
<b>There is a small flash of light and a small cloud of smoke rises from the ingredients in the cylinder.</b>
You and everyone else in the room are knocked over onto the floor.

One quintuplet of chemicals in the right order:
<b>Suddenly there is a huge bang, and a shockwave of noise from the chamber, causing many of the rivets to fire off with a loud 'PING!'.</b>
A couple of students who were standing too close hold their heads in pain as blood streams from their ears.
This makes everyone "shocked and confused", as with a backstab, with stat penalties.

All chemicals in the right order: BOOM!
<b>The whole lab begins to rumble ominously, causing the students to flee immediately.</b>
There is an enormous explosion as one of the vats blows up in a shower of deadly shrapnel, which is quite unfortunate for those brave students who did not choose to run.

Don't leave the room.
You'll end up on top of the Tower of Art with a diamond, a lump of gold, and a broken leg.
 (If you're carrying enough things, the addition of the diamond, lump of gold, and Creator Collector Card in your inventory can cause you to fumble things <i>in midair</i> and lose them.)

Damage when succeeding seems to be a percentage of your total hit points.
 If you aren't damaged when you get the right combination, you won't die.

If, for some reason, the guild blows up but it's not because you have the right combination, after everything's rebuilt, you can go back to the amalgamator and continue trying levers.

There can be multiple reactions per combination.
If we had the target combination of 147784 for example, the following attempts would give the following results:
141414 - 3 pairs
747877 - 2 pairs
877777 - 1 triplet
877141 - 1 triplet and 1 pair
487741 - Quest accomplished

So chemicals usually don't have to be in the same order or in the same position (2nd from left, etc) to get a reaction, they just have to be in the right order relative to each other.
However, it seems that occasionally they will need to be in a specific order to get the full reaction--trying a known pair at the <i>beginning</i> of the combination, followed by every possible option may yield only pair reactions, while trying the same pair at the <i>end</i> of the combination reveals the triplet.
I.E.:
561111 - 1 pair
...
569999 - 1 pair
560000 - 1 pair
651111 - 1 pair
...
659999 - 1 pair
650000 - 1 pair
999965 - 1 triplet
597965 - Quest accomplished
(Actual example.)

I like the following system to find pairs (10 written as 0):
112233
445566
778899
001314
151617
181920
242526
272829
313435
363738
394041
etc

So after each combo, you jot down the results, and if there was a pair, you immediately try to find a third chemical adjacent to the pair.
So if you try 112233 and immediately get the pair reaction, you can then narrow down which 2 numbers were the pair by trying 111111 222222 333333 121212 232323 until one reacts as a pair again.
Except it should react as 3 pairs because you're repeating the correct pair 3 times.

So if 121212 shows three pairs, you know 12 (or 21) is in the target combination somewhere.
Then you try to find the number(s) adjacent to 12.
If 12 is at the beginning or end of the target combination, there will be only one adjacent number, otherwise there are two.
So now you want to try 12 in combination with other numbers, such as:
331233
441244
551255
etc

Then when you get a triplet, such as from 332133, you test whether the 3 is next to the 2 or the 1:
321111
312222

So if 312222 gives the triplet, we know the triplet is 312, not 321.
We then repeat the same process, now with the 312 triplet adjacent to other numbers, and so on.

This system should get the target combination in 15-30 minutes, depending on how lucky you are with side effects and the early combinations you try.

<b>Skills:</b> 100 crafts.culinary.cooking bonus, 70 crafts.culinary.butchering bonus
<b>Items:</b> sausage (All Hours Cafe on Dimwell Street)
<b>Items:</b> ground garlic (in the garden of Temple of Small Gods, witch gardens, Scrogden garden, or terrains outside Djelibeybi - Grind in a grinder in a witch's house)
<b>Items:</b> scumble (from any tavern)
<b>Items:</b> shot/measure glass (any nearby tavern)
<b>Items:</b> 1 bottle of beer (any nearby tavern)
<b>Items:</b> lard (tub in Gimlet's back room)
<b>Items:</b> flour (bag in Gimlet's back room)
<b>Items:</b> 1 bottle of water (fill from the sink in Ironcrust's Bakery)

Go to Thomas Eddiesson's house on Cable Street and:
  "say Hey Igor.
What is the recipe for fatsup? How would you make it?"
  "say What sort of spirit based alcohol alcoholic bribe would you like, Igor?"
  "bribe" the Igor upstairs with the scumble.

He'll give you a recipe that involves the items listed above.
 First you need to mix those, then fix the stove afterward, when you're ready to cook.
 Here's a step by step guide to mixing:
  search dresser
  get pan
  fill shot glass from water bottle
  pour shot glass into pan
  fill shot glass from beer
  pour shot glass into pan

Basically the beer has to be in a 1:1 ratio to the water.
 As far as the amount, keep adding water and beer in the above ratios until the pan is about half full.
 But the net result should be that the pan only has "watery beer" in it.
 If you have too much of one liquid, it will look like "watery beer and water", which means you should add a little more beer.

Next:
  put a lot of ground garlic in pan
  get garlic from pan
This works because excess solid ingredients can be removed from the pan, unlike liquids.
 You should now have only "garlicky watery beer" in your pan.

Next:
  put a lot of flour in pan
  get flour from pan
You should now have "beer and garlic gravy".

Next:
  put a lot of lard in pan
  get lard from pan
You should now have "greasy beer and garlic gravy".

Next:
  put sausages in slicer
  slice all in slicer
  get all from slicer
  put all sausages in pan
  get sausages from pan
This should give you "uncooked fatsup".

<i>***TANGATHOR 03/28/11***</i>
(In addition to the above information, I found the solution for me included "Brandy" in a very minimal amount)
  I used-
9 Shot Glasses of Water
9 Shot Glasses of Beer
12 Drops of Brandy (1/32 of a Phial (Buy a brandy, then "Fill phial 1/32 from Brandy")
&lt;add garlic, flour, and lard then remove&gt;
3-4 sausages (depending on the number of slices you get from the slicer...i added then 1 at a time then checked the pan to ensure it was all turning to "Uncooked Fatsup"
as I was NOT able to remove sausage from the pan for some reason)

Next you need to fix the stove.
  "turn stove up" and it should indicate a faulty wire.
  "repair" that wire and keep trying until it's ready to cook.

Turn the stove up to 120 or so, and pay very close attention to messages indicating how fast the fatsup is cooking, and "check temp on stove".
 If it's cooking too quickly, turn it down.
 If it's cooking too slowly, turn it up.
 You'll have to adjust the temperature at least a few times.

If you fail at the cooking, you'll get an icky mess and have to start over from the very beginning.

If you succeed in getting "congealed fatsup", give it to Thomas.
 He'll give you a light bulb.

<b>Items:</b> copper stick (from the shelf in the Witch Cottage in Mad Stoat)
Time: Night (this allows the button to induce thunder and lightning)
Weather: medium cloud cover or more, gentle breeze was enough, no precipitations needed

Go to the clock tower north of the Five Ways intersection.
"Look tubes" to make sure one hasn't burst recently from someone else doing the quest - if it is burst you have to wait until the room regens (30 minutes on average).

Go northeast, northwest, "move slab".
Go down and "push button" to make the weather nasty on the roof.
This changes to weather in the pole room on the roof to be two levels more cloudy, more windy and cooler and torrential rain.
This needs to be enough to make it a storm.
See the <a href="/wiki/Weather" title="Weather">weather</a> and <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> pages for the levels.

Go back outside the tower and "climb up" twice, then "climb rope".
Go south and "climb up" again, then go north to the center of the roof.

With FULL HP "hold copper stick", "grasp pole", then "touch wire with stick".
If there's a thunderstorm on ("Peals of thunder and streaks of lightning rend the sky.") you will be struck by lightning, go flying off the roof and probably break a leg and end up with less than 5 hp.

Go back to the basement room, optionally set the dials and switches on the machine, and "pull lever".
It should make some kind of coffee.

After completing the POTTER'S FRIEND quest, make 5 plates and 5 bowls in the Potter's workshop on the north end of Cockbill Street.
Buy clay in the northern room, and the rest of the tools are available to use in the wheel room.

Steps:

1) "throw" the clay onto the wheel
2) unhold all
3) "mould" the clay into a plate or bowl
4) get the plate or bowl from the wheel
5) get and hold the brush
6) "glaze" the plate or bowl with the cochineal glaze
7) wait for the plate to dry (the glaze doesn't need to)
8) "fire" the plate or bowl (multiples can be done at the same time as well) in the kiln.
    The success message is "You select a shelf, carefully place a (item) in the kiln and adjust the air flow." and the failure message is "You put a (item) in the kiln.".
    If you get a failure message the item will explode, but you can get the item from the kiln while holding tongs and try to fire it again once it cools.
9) "check" items in the kiln until they're done.
    There's no harm done leaving them in too long.
10) get and hold the tongs
11) get the items from the kiln and put them on the drying rack if you want them to cool faster

The plates have to be plain, pleasant, or fine for the potter to accept them.
The glaze can be as crappy as you like and the potter won't care.
Take the plates, some at a time or all at once, to the wandering potter and say "help" and then "assist".
Give him the plates and bowls and you'll get 1 shiny dollar for each.

<b>Skills:</b> 128 or more adventuring.movement.climbing.rock bonus (unhold all, no shoes, light burden)
<b>Items:</b> Rake (smithy on northeast side of Street of Small Gods)
Go to the Shonky Shop on Clay Lane and wander around until you get to the room with Brother Soon Shine Sun.
Go through the hidden exit east here then continue east to a yard with a locked gate.
"Climb" the wall and go west into the History Monks temple, then say "help" when Ludlakk is in the room.
He'll give you a piece of paper with a grid design on it to be raked into the sand.
"rake" the grid based on the grid coordinates, to form the letters and symbols displayed.
"syntax rake" is very helpful.
If you cross over a previously raked section, you'll have to rake it again.
Before you start, look at the design on the paper and figure out you're path for going back and forth while avoiding the rocks.

<b>Items:</b> a few dollars (or tickets, if you have some from completing Prolific Paster), and possibly a friend depending on how you want to do it
When in the Dwarf museum, you need to get your tooth jolted out.
There are multiple ways to loosen it and finally knock it out:

*Eating the scone from the water dunking game. (The scone is not consumed.)
*Eating a tessera won from a game. (The tessera is not consumed.)
*Eating dwarf bread prizes bought with tessera. (Misfortune cookies are consumed, but others aren't.)
*Standing on the platform of the strength tester and having someone else play the game.

If you get messages about your tooth feeling a bit looser, etc., then it's working.
You may need to wait a little while in between eating the scone or tesserae
(alternatively, you may not get a message every time it's loosened a bit).

At the entrance to the museum, search the walls to find the hidden room and unlock the door using the key that can be won from the lucky dip game.
You could also pick the door, but a bonus of 327 in covert.lockpick.doors fail repeatedly.
Place the tooth under the pillow, lie on the bed and then sleep...
Repeat this until you get the quest and one dollar from the tooth fairy.

<b>Skills:</b> 200+ adventuring.perception bonus (200 will succeed infrequently when measuring), 120+ people.culture.ankh-morporkian bonus
<b>Items:</b> measuring tape, chisel, and crowbar (tool shop on Ettercap Street)
Go to the west side of Ankh-Morpork, along Endless Street.
There's a wall you can look at in each room starting 5 rooms n/nw of Limping Gate and going to one south of Shambling Gate.
These are the only rooms the quest will be in.
In a random wall room, you can "search wall" to find a piece of paper.
Another random wall room will have the next step in the quest.
To find the room, start at one end of the wall and "measure wall" with the measuring tape until you see something about an odd stone and crumbling mortar.
Measuring too many times within a given time period will cause your eyes to cross and you will have to wait several minutes for them to uncross to continue.
Once you have found the correct wall room, "chip mortar" while holding the chisel until the mortar is gone, then "lever block" while holding the crowbar until the block comes out.

<b>Skills:</b> some ad.perception?, some co.ca.place, some co.lo.door, some co.lo.traps, possibly co.ma.stealing, co.it.traps?, some fighting.
This quest involves disarming traps a few times.
You have to be able to spot the traps in order to disarm them, otherwise you'll get hurt.

To complete this quest, you will first need an iron amulet from the wind demon upstairs in the Old Mansion on Short Street south of Brother David's.
To get this, enter the mansion (see SEASONED EXPLORER), go up, and go west.
Search (possible skillcheck here) to find a lever, pull lever, go up.
There's an exit west, then go south.
Open the door using a key, it should be the one from the dwarf corpse, or just lockpick it.
In the next room you need to disarm the flame trap before you can head south.

To get the wind demon to appear, open the box, and it will come out and autoattack.
Kill it to get its amulet, or if you're a thief, filch the amulet from the demon.
Or just kill the demon if you want to.
Don't wear the amulet because it breaks easily in combat.
The room should reset in about 30 minutes and allow another wind demon to come out if you need another amulet because the banshee respawned too fast (sometimes it can be near instantaneous).

Go to the hidden cellar from SEASONED EXPLORER by pressing the switch inside the front door and go down, then south.

The east exit of the room with the dwarf corpse is trapped with a blade trap.
Either disarm the trap, or crawl.

Then open the east door with the key from Stavic, or lockpick it if you wish.

In the next room, there are three demons.
They don't autoattack, but you must kill them to go east again.
The demons spawn relatively quickly - 5 minutes or so, in my experience - so get the amulet from the wind demon upstairs first.) Try not to die.
It's a bit of a hassle to retrieve stuff from one's corpse when there are demons and locked doors.

In the next room is a banshee and a gas trap.
"Use amulet on banshee" and it will disappear and the amulet will crumble to dust.
Hurry up to disarm the gas trap because the banshee respawns fast and if it does you need to go fetch another amulet and by then the demons and blade trap will have respawned too.

In the next room there is a greater demon (that does not autoattack) that can only be killed if you have done the MASTER OF CEREMONIES quest.
Just reaching this room will get you the VETERAN EXPLORER quest and $75.
You can proceed to the CRYPT ROBBER quest above which involves killing the greater demon.
