<h4>This tool is...</h4>
<h4>Safe.</h4>
<p style="color:#999">You should think before typing your password into a strange page online. But this page is designed to protect you. It is static: no information you enter will be transmitted over the internet. The test is done 100% on YOUR computer.</p>
<h4>Basic.</h4>
<p style="color:#999">This tool tests for all the usual problems with weak passwords. The metrics gleaned from long hours of cracking passwords. But there are still things it does not check. For instance, if does not check for your name or birthdate in the password; though people using such private information is a common password mistake.</p>
