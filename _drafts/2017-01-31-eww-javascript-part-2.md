summary: Everything Wrong With JavaScript - Part 2 - Minor Problems

{% include JB/setup %}

In part 1 of this series, we covered the major problems with JavaScript. But not all of the problems with JavaScript are large-scale systemic problems. Some of the problems are just niggling little details which demand that you constantly work around them. Those petty annoyances are what we are covering today.

Again, I want to make it clear that I like the language. It has a friendly, homemade LISP feel, and I appreciate it for its minimalist structure. Most major languages bloat up hugely as they age, but JavaScript has not.

### Minor Problems

What follows will be the least technical part of the EWW JavaScript series. These are just the petty, little things that bother people, but not the serious structural flaws we will meet later in the series.

#### The Name

JavaScript is a terrible name.  Basically everyone who encounters the language the first time is forced to ask the question:

> Hey, wait, is JavaScript related to Java?

The answer, of course, is no.  But why create the confusion in the first place?  It turns out this was a ploy made by the handsomest guys in marketing at Netscape in 1995. And we're stuck with it. 

#### Array.length

TODO

#### NaN

    >> typeof(NaN)
    Number

You read that right, the type of "Not a Number" is "Number".

#### ==

TODO

#### etc

TODO

#### etc

TODO

#### etc

TODO

### To Be Continued?

Have I missed something? What is it about JavaScript that drives you insane? Tell us in the comments below.
