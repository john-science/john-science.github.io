Noether's Theorem is so general it serves as the foundation for nearly all other scientific principles: conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, conservation of name-a-thing. Strangley, it is not taught to undergraduate physics majors in America.  Perhaps this is because the theory is so general it is hard to find a practical problem that a student can sink their teeth into. Or maybe education is not what it is cracked up to be.  Maybe Emmy Noether just never got famous enough, who knows.

Einstein had nothing but [extremely flattering](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/03/23/emmy-noether-google-doodle-why-einstein-called-her-a-creative-mathematical-genius/) things to say about Noether, who remains one of the greatest scientific minds ever.

Anyway, let us talk about the theory.
