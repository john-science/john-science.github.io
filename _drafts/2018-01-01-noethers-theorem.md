## Outline
  
The goal of this talk is to explain Noether's Theorem at a no-math level, and give a brief biography of Emmy Noether.

Ideally, this will be presentable in 10-20 minutes.

Ideally, it will be fully presentable with no diagrams, or only a couple diagrams which are hand-drawable.


### Life up to the Theorem

Emmy Noether was born in Germany in 1882. In 1900 she decided to go into mathematics at the university. This was absolutely scandolous at the time. In fact, even though her father was a math professor, she still couldn't officially enroll. She had to unoffically audit every math class for her undergradate. She never took an exam or handed in a homework. But in those days there was one big exam at the end of undergraduate to get your degree. And she crushed that exam, so she got her undergaduate degree in Mathematics. And when she got her PhD in math, she was one of the first women in Germany got get a PhD ever.

However, women couldn't be professors, so she had to survive on a (very small) inheritance from her father. She did odd jobs covering lectures for faculty to make ends meet. She was a prodigous mathematician, publishing frequently. But she could never be the first author on a paper.

- Noether helped Einstein and Hilbert on GR
- Noether gave lectures at Hilbert's university in 1915 and it was so scandalous she had to officially be his "assistant" for her lecture series


### The Theorem

- proved in 1915, published in 1918
- Noether's Theorem: for every symmetry in nature there is a corresponding conservation law. (And vice versa.) (The math is roughly: Principle of Least Action + a symmetry + Noether's Theorm = Law of Nature. Just be clear, Nother came up with a way to *generate* the laws of nature. The theorem is the tool which is used to create, build, and understand the laws of nature; all of the conservation laws. Newton watched the world and found conserved quantities, and Nother developed a theorem which explained WHY they were conserved.
- Principle of Least Action: kinetic - potential energy is conserved. The universe is lazy. Imagine the path a golf ball takes in an arc from a golfer. Now imagine that path swirling up 1000 yards in a spiral after it leaves the golfer but landing in the same spot at the end. That's wrong, right? Now imagine the golf ball leaving the golfer and hitting the same spot at the end, but snaking left to right wildly hundreds of yards skimming the grass. Still wrong, yeah? The path it takes is the laziest one for nature, it's the one that minimizes the action.
- Laws of motion: spatial symmetries. Work, heat, mass -> time. Take all the other laws of nature and now we know WHY.

#### Example Symmetries

> Describe what a symmetry is. That's always fun.

- What if the entire universe was a bit to the right of where it is now?
  + What if the whole universe was exactly the same as it is now, but it started 4 seconds earlier?
  + What if the entire universe was suddenly rotated by 10%, including you?
- An asteroid flying through deep space.
  + It doesn't speed up or slow down, it just keeps flying.
  + It doesn't suddenly turn or change directory, it flies straight.
  + At any point along it's path it looks the same, flying forward at the same speed. It is "symmetric" in changes along this path. And it conserves its forward momentum.
  + This is where we get conservation of momentum, from symmetries in translation.
- You run a simple chemistry experiment: you add flame to some methane in the presence of air. It explodes.
  + If you set up your experiment exactly the same an hour in the past as an hour in the future you would get the same result: boom.
  + This means your experiment is "symmetric" to changes in time. And you know that the explosion always has the same amount of energy, so the "energy" of your experiment is conserved. 
  + This is why energy is conserved, because all the experiments you can think of are "symmetric" to changes in time, as long as you do the experiment exactly the same way each time.
- A moon in a stable orbit around a cold, dead star. But, you know, up beat. (Conservation of angular momentum)
- "gauge symmetry" of EM field -> charge conservation

### Life After the Theorem

- 1908-1931 University of Goettingen, Math
- In 1919 she was denied a faculty position at her university (Goettingen). "What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?"
- So it was, in 1922, that she got her first academic income, as a Privatdozent (something closer to a grad student than a professor).
- 1932/33 - Jewish intellectual, liberal pacifist. One of first 6 professors in Germany to be fired.
- Her brother was also a math professor. They both fled Germany. Her brother went to Russia, she went to the US. She turned to Einstein and he convinced the Rockefeller committee to aid displaced German Scholars. She got a one-year gig at Bryn Mawr college in Pennsylvania. (First paid position at 51.)
- At the end of her one year, she had to scramble for funding. One of the leading mathematicians alive.
- Reputation for being a really challenging teacher. She had a squad of male (only) students in Germany who would follow her around called "Noether's Boys". Bryn Mawr was a female only school.
- Emmy did a lot of the tensor math that were needed to formulate space-time for Einstein. She was one of the few people that help set the mathematical stage for Einstein's GR. He was her mentor.
- She died at 53 after an ovarian cancer surgery.
- There is a certain amount mythos about a great mind dying young. Painters have Van Gogh. Mathematicians and Physicists have Emmy Noether.
- Einstein called her two years at Pennsylvania’s Bryn Mawr “the happiest and perhaps the most fruitful of her entire career.”
- she appears to have loved math first and foremost in her life, passionately
- Einstein called her a genius.
