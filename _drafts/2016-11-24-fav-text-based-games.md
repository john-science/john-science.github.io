summary: A quick look at my favourite text-based games.
---
{% include JB/setup %}

I love text-based games. I also love 3D games, but there are plenty of people talking about those. I love games that were created by a single person, or a small team. I think such games come out with a better story and a more cohesive personality.

I also love to think that one day I could create such a game. Without the need for 3D graphics and a rich sound track, it's just possible that I could create a simple little game that a few people out there would play and love, if only for a short time. A boy can dream.

**All these games are free to play, right now!**


### ADOM

> 1994-Present, [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), moderate plot

```

```

ADOM is a roguelike with more story than most. I don't want to spoiler it, but you're saving the world from some sort of invasion. Most of the monsters you fight are involved with the invasion and there is somewhat more thought put into how it all ties together. The latest version even has an isomorphic 2.5-dimensional display, if straight text isn't your thing. This is the only roguelike to go commerical, but it's still free to play, not freemium. And the community is alive and well. It's a well-developed game with a good culture behind it.

### Anchorhead

> 1998, [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)

    > n
    You close your umbrella, as is your habit after coming indoors.
    
    Local Pub
    A dank, drafty old drinking hole lit by flickering oil-burning lanterns. Smoke collects in greasy pools among the rafters, and shadows crowd thick around. The bar runs the length of the room to your right, while to the south a low doorway opens onto the street.
    Mill workers and fisherman occupy a few of the tables, drinking beer or puffy grimly at long-stemmed pipes. Each is wrapped in his solitude, soaking up the general miasma of dreary fatalism.
    The lantern sitting on the table nearest you sputters fitfully, throwing distorted shadows across the wall.
    
    > say "Help! I'm being chased!" to the fisherman
    No one answers you, or even looks your way.

Anchorhead is based on the works of HP Lovecraft, especially the stories involving Cthulu. It is interactive fiction, but something more in the vein of a puzzle game. And there are strains of an open-world explorer here as sometimes you need to look around the world a bit to solve the puzzle. Perhaps the highlight of the game is the writing, which has the haunting tone you'd want from a story about Cthulu. I must admit, I find this game to be difficult. Perhaps I am too used to games phoning it in and making obvious puzzles, where Anchorhead doesn't slap you in the face with the puzzle, you have to figure out what you need to be doing next. I went into the game expecting an atmospheric spooky game, and got everything I wanted.

### Angband

> 1990-Present, [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), little plot (open-source)

Angband is perhaps slightly less popular that NetHack (see below), but the early game is designed a big better for players new to "roguelikes". Angband has a lot of flexibility and configuration at the start, which Nethack lacks. And a slightly nicer interface, so it's better for beginners. Though I think like NetHack had a bigger online presence. People new to the genre might see little difference between Angband and NetHack.

This game grows steadily more interesting and intricate as you play. The world is a dangerous place and you lead a village to protect people against the night. You also explore the world to bring things back to your village. You can play the game where you work for the betterment of your village, or where the village works to support your adventures. But you will probably end up somewhere in the middle. But either way you will have to manage the people and resources of your village to help build the things people need. The game also has a fun mechanic where if you die, a new village takes over and you play as them.

### Candy Box

> 2013, puzzle-based [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game)

```

At first this will barely feel like a game; there's nothing to it. But the more you play the more it grows. The more there is to do. But I don't think there is any way for me to talk about this game without spoilering it, or at least seriously spoilering the opening. So all I will say is it is puzzle-based.

### Discworld MUD

> 1991-Present, [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game)

    Turnwise Broadway [nw, se]
    Hp: 1610 (1610) Gp: 255 (285) Xp: 82361
    You hack the sailor's stomach with your Dragon Fang.
    > slash sailor with fang
    You prepare to slash the sailor with the tiger fang.
    
    Hp: 1610 (1610) Gp: 233 (285) Xp: 82599
    You launch a powerful attack. You chop up the sailor's right arm with your tiger fang.
    You kill the sailor.
    You get the feeling that someone is watching you - as if this is all a game somehow.    

The Discworld MUD is a hilarious, old school MUD based on Terry Pratchett's wildly successful comedy fantasy book series. This open-world game has more content than any other game ever created. No joke, the community has been adding content for 25 years now and you will never, ever see it all. The game is generally pretty funny, and though some players have had the same character for years, there is serious permadeath in the game. This is my all-time favorite MUD, and I have spent so much time playing it I should probably be embarassed. (I'm not.) GNU Terry Pratchett.

### Dwarf Fortress

> 2002-Present, [tile-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game), world simulator, dwarf-mine simulator

Dwarf Fortress is a phenomenon. It is, by a wide margin, the most complicated game in the world. You control a dirty band of dwarves, trying to build a new mine to call home. But the world is brutal and hard and it takes a lot to build a society that will stand the tests of time. Anything is possible in this game, and the amount of detail is amazing. But you will also have to learn more than you ever have to play the game, and you will have to micromanage every detail of the lives of all your dwarves to succeed. There is also a less popular, optional play style in this game where you are just one dwarf roaming the world as an adventurer. Though this doesn't appear to be nearly as popular as the fortress-building mode. If you meet someone who plays this game, they will have hilarious stories to tell you. But *never* disparage their game; they might go berzerk and attack you with a chair.

### The Hitchhiker's Guide

> 1984, [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)

    > stab gaurd with the flathead screwdriver
    I don't know the word "stab".

    > escape
    You are so keen to escape that you literally leap through the fabric of the space-time continuum. You wake up in a shack in tenth-century Earth. A dressing gown, a toothbrush, and a flathead axe lie by your bed. Before you have a chance to move, Mongol hordes sweep magnificently across the plains of central Asia. They knock down your shack and burn the remains with you inside. You lost interest in the rest of the game.

The Hitchhiker's Guide is a hilarious, plot-based, story-driven game based on the hit sci-fi comedy novel by Douglas Adams. Adams had a real gift for humor and loved technology. The writing in the game is great, with a really relaxed and fun tone. It follows the story of the first book in the series pretty closely. The game itself *might* be easier if you've read the book, but honestly I doubt it. This game will kill you - a lot. If that sounds frustrating, this probably isn't the game for you.

**Pro Tip #1:** If you type "restart" after you die, sometimes you will start up in the next chapter of the game, instead of having to start from scratch.

**Pro Tip #2:** If you're version of the game allows you to save your progress, do it as often as you can.

NetHack is possibly the most popular roguelike out there (see Angband). It's classic. Fight to the bottom level of a dungeon, find a thing, and fight your way back up again. The online community is big and active. Live-streaming serves allow players to watch each other to learn to do better. NetHack is, perhaps, a bit less beginner friendly. But unlike Angband, there is a clear way for people to compare scores and compete.

These days you can even play NetHack on your phone (with or without graphics). Since the original game expected you had a full keyboard, a lot of these games are pretty awkward to play. But after trying a dozen of them or so, my favourite is the iOS app [iNetHack 2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inethack2/id962114968?mt=8).

Rogue was the start of it all. (Not really, look up "Colossal Cave Adventure".) It is a tile-based, text-only, procedurally-generated, RPG where you delve dungeons, fight evil monsters, and collect treasure. The goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon to find a thing. It is a quintessential classic. These days, you're probably better off playing NetHack or Angband; Rogue was a one-off game but NetHack and Angband are alive and well. The major reasons to play Rogue are: (1) historical, and (2) it is far less complex than Angband and NetHack.

### Zork

> 1977-1982, [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)

```
Forest
> UP
You have moved into a dark place.
It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

> N
Oh, no! You have walked into the slavering fangs of a luring grue!

   **** You have died ****
```

Zork is interactive fiction from the dawn of Unix Time. You are dropped into a world and given no introduction as to why you are there. You have to figure everything out for yourself. There will be puzzles to solve, though you won't be told that. This is one of those old-school adventures where you better remember seeing that bottle of water half an hour ago or you'll never been able to open this door. The game originally got popular though because the user-input is pretty forgiving.
