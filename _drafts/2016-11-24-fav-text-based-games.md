summary: A quick look at my favourite text-based games.
---
{% include JB/setup %}

I love text-based games. I also love 3D games, but there are plenty of people talking about those. I love games that were created by a single person, or a small team. I think such games come out with a better story and a more cohesive personality.

I also love to think that one day I could create such a game. Without the need for 3D graphics and a rich sound track, it's just possible that I could create a simple little game that a few people out there would play and love, if only for a short time. A boy can dream.

**All these games are free to play, right now!**


### ADOM

> 1994-Present, [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), moderate plot

ADOM is a roguelike with more story than most. I don't want to spoiler it, but I know you're saving the world from some sort of invasion. Most of the monsters you fight are involved with the invasion and there is somewhat more thought put into how it all ties together. The latest version even has an isomorphic 2.5-dimensional display, if straight text isn't your thing. This is the only roguelike to go commerical, but it's still free to play, not freemium. And the community is alive and well. It's a well-developed game with a good culture behind it.

### Anchorhead

> 1998, [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)

Anchorhead is based on the works of HP Lovecraft, especially the stories involving Cthulu. It is interactive fiction, but something more in the vein of a puzzle game. And there are strains of an open-world explorer here as sometimes you need to look around the world a bit to solve the puzzle. Perhaps the highlight of the game is the writing, which has the haunting tone you'd want from a story about Cthulu. I must admit, I find this game to be difficult. Perhaps I am too used to games phoning it in and making obvious puzzles, where Anchorhead doesn't slap you in the face with the puzzle, you have to figure out what you need to be doing next. I've never "finished" this game, though I'd like to one day. I went into the game expecting an atmospheric spooky game, and got everything I wanted.

### Angband

> 1990-Present, [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), little plot (open-source)

Angband is possibly the most popular roguelike out there (see NetHack). When people say a game is "roguelike", they mean Angband. Angband has a lot of flexibility and configuration at the start, which Nethack lacks. And a slightly nicer interface, so it's better for beginners. Though I felt like NetHack had a bigger online presence. If I was stuck in bed with the flu and wanted to play a Roguelike, I would play Angband.

### A Dark Room

> 2013, [tile-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game), [RTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy) [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game), [tower defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense)

This game grows steadily more interesting and intricate as you play. The world is a dangerous place and you lead a village to protect people against the night. You also explore the world to bring things back to your village. You can play the game where you work for the betterment of your village, or where the village works to support your adventures. But you will probably end up somewhere in the middle. But either way you will have to manage the people and resources of your village to help build the things people need. The game also has a fun mechanic where if you die, a new village takes over and you play as them.

### Candy Box

> 2013, puzzle-based [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game)

At first this will barely feel like a game; there's nothing to it. But the more you play the more it grows. The more there is to do. But I don't think there is any way for me to talk about this game without spoilering it, or at least seriously spoilering the opening. So all I will say is it is puzzle-based.

### Discworld MUD

> 1991-Present, [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD), [RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game)

The Discworld MUD is a hilarious, old school MUD based on Terry Pratchett's wildly successful comedy fantasy book series. This open-world game has more content than any other game ever created. No joke, the community has been adding content for 25 years now and you will never, ever see it all. The game is generally pretty funny, and though some players have had the same character for years, there is serious permadeath in the game. This is my all-time favorite MUD, and I have spent so much time playing it I should probably be embarassed. (I'm not.) GNU Terry Pratchett.

### Dwarf Fortress

> 2002-Present, [tile-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile-based_video_game), world simulator, dwarf-mine simulator

Dwarf Fortress is a phenomenon. It is, by a wide margin, the most complicated game in the world. You control a dirty band of dwarves, trying to build a new mine to call home. But the world is brutal and hard and it takes a lot to build a society that will stand the tests of time. Anything is possible in this game, and the amount of detail is amazing. But you will also have to learn more than you ever have to play the game, and you will have to micromanage every detail of the lives of all your dwarves to succeed. There is also a less popular, optional play style in this game where you are just one dwarf roaming the world as an adventurer. Though this doesn't appear to be nearly as popular as the fortress-building mode. If you meet someone who plays this game, they will have hilarious stories to tell you. But *never* disparage their game; they might go berzerk and attack you with a chair.

### The Hitchhiker's Guide

> 1984, [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)

The Hitchhiker's Guide is a hilarious, plot-based, story-driven game based on the hit sci-fi comedy novel by Douglas Adams. Adams had a real gift for humor and loved technology. The writing in the game is great, with a really relaxed and fun tone. It follows the story of the first book in the series pretty closely. The game itself *might* be easier if you've read the book, but honestly I doubt it. This game will kill you a lot. If that sounds frustrating, this probably isn't the game for you.

**Pro Tip #1:** If you type "restart" after you die, sometimes you will start up in the next chapter of the game, instead of having to start from scratch.

**Pro Tip #2:** If you're version of the game allows you to save your progress, do it a lot. Because you're going to die a lot.

### NetHack

> 1987-2015, [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), little plot (open source)

NetHack is possibly the most popular roguelike out there (or it's tied with Angband).  It's classic. Fight to the bottom level of a dungeon, find a thing, and fight your way back up again. The online community is alive and well. People can watch each other play to learn to do better. When people say a game is "roguelike", they mean NetHack (or Angband). NetHack is a bit less friendly than Angband, at least for noobs. You have less options for how you want to configure the game, and the interface might be a bit less friendly. But it's a better game for people to compare scores with, and people play on servers that automatically live-stream their games for other people to watch.

These days you can even play NetHack on your phone (with or without graphics). I think the controls are a bit awkward to get used to on most, but I think the iOS version iNetHack2 has the best controls.

### Rogue

> 1980, [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), little plot

Rogue was the start of it all. (Not really, look up "Colossal Cave Adventure".) It is a tile-based, text-only, procedurally-generated, RPG where you delve dungeons, fight evil monsters, and collect treasure. The goal is to get to the bottom of the dungeon to find a thing. It is a quintessential classic. These days, you're probably better off playing NetHack or Angband. I can't say I've played the original "Rogue" much, as NetHack and Angband have had years of growth and improvment starting from Rogue. But I still feel like Rogue is an easier game to learn, and feels a lot less stressful than the two more hardcore versions.

These days you can play Rogue on your phone (with or without graphics). I think the controls are a bit awkward to get used to on most version, so I'm still looking for the best.

### Zork

> 1977-1982, [interactive fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction)

Zork is interactive fiction from the dawn of Unix Time. You are dropped into a world and given no introduction as to why you are there. You have to figure everything out for yourself. There will be puzzles to solve, though you won't be told that. This is one of those old-school adventures where you better remember seeing that bottle of water half an hour ago or you'll never been able to open this door. The interface is very forgiving with the words you choose though. You will be pwned by a Grue.
