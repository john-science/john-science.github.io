alt="A 100 Trillion Dollar Bill">

The first time I saw the Zimbabwe 100 trillion dollar bill, I just had to have one. There was something exciting and fun at getting to hold a banknote in my hand that said "Trillion" on it. How cool.

I still enjoy having a piece of that history. But, of course, as part of enjoying the item I decided I had to learn more about how it came into existence. That immediately squashed the fun, of course. Inflation is a normal part of a healthy economy, but this kind of hyperinflation signals a hard time for a lot of people.

Only a handful of times in history have governments gotten desparate enough to print a single banknote of over a million units:

In some way, of course, all money is fake. It has value because people believe it has value. But you can't help believe that is more true above - for those places and times in the world.
