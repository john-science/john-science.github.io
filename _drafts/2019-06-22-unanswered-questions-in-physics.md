Below is a list of the most fundamental unsolved problems in physics.

Just to be clear, in order to make the list there must be a real-world, physical observation that does not fit with our understanding of the universe. For instance, a lot of physicists are looking for room-temperature super conductors. This is an important, unsolved problem in physics. But there is no observation of the real world that breaks the standard model there, this is almost an engineering problem, in that there is no guarantee that finding a room-temperature super conductor would increase our understanding of the universe.

Please note the date of publication in the URL of this post. Things change and the biggest questions in physics don't *stay* unanswered.


## The human race does not yet understand:

* [Neutrino oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation) - We see neutrinos oscillate through different flavors, but we do not have a precise theoretical understanding of how this happens. To the point where the neutrino might even have mass, albeit a very small mass, and we have never seen *that* before.
* Dark Matter and Dark Energy - Apparent to astrophysicists, there is more matter and energy in the universe than is visible or easily explainable. It does not appear explanable by modifying gravity or blackholes, and based on the astrophysicist models of stellar growth of main-sequence stars, there is something missing.
