Below is a list of the most fundamental and important unsolved problems in physics. Just to be clear, in order to make the list there must be a real-world, physical observation that does not fit with our understanding of the universe. For instance, finding a room temperature super conductor would be awesome, but there is no unexplained observation there it is just a very hard (and important) engineering problem.

Please note the date of publication in the URL of this post. Things change and the biggest questions in physics don't *stay* unanswered.


## The human race does not yet understand:

* [Neutrino oscillations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino_oscillation) - We see neutrinos oscillate through different flavors, but we do not have a precise theoretical understanding of how this happens. To the point where the neutrino might even have mass, albeit a very small mass, and we have never seen *that* before.
