> I am not a professional financial anything. This is just my own personal retirment research. Caveat emptor.

What follows is an absolute-basic introduction to mutual funds for people new to retirement investing.


## 0. What is a Mutual Fund

A mutual fund is a managed portfolio of stocks and investments that is curated for you using a stated, disciplined investment strategy.


## 1. Risk vs Return

#### Small Cap vs Large Cap

Mutual funds usually list themselves as [Small Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp), [Mid Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp), or [Large Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp). The "Cap" is short for market capitalization. (In detail, to count as Small Cap a company needs $300 million in capitalization, $2-$10 billion for Mid Cap, and over $10 for Large Cap.) So, when you hear "Large Cap" think Coca-Cola and Google.

The idea here is larger companies are less risky. The standard wisdom is that Coca-Cola is such a big company that the chances of it's stock being worth $0 next year is virtually zero. But a smaller company (like a local restaurant chain) actually *could* go out of buisness suddenly. So larger companies are typically seen as less risky.

#### Value vs Growth

Mutual funds are also frequently broken into "value" or "growth" categories (or "blend" which is just a mix of the two). A "value" fund is one that is "cheap" right now, when compared with it's past earnings and reasonable estimates of its current evaluation. A "growth" fund is one that is currently growing really fast and is likely to yield some profits in the very near term. A "blend" fund takes stocks from both of these categories.

The general philosophy is that growth funds can yield higher profits, but are also a little riskier.

#### The Cap vs Growth Graph

Now that we have those two sets of terms defined we can look at our first risk vs reward chart.

![Cap vs Growth Graph](/assets/images/invest/cap_vs_growth.gif)

The idea here is that a "Small Cap, Growth Fund" tends to take on more volatile stocks, which can mean greater profits but definitely means greater risk. Conversely, "Large Cap, Value Funds" are probably much more stable in the long-term. Again, in theory. 

On the surface, a graph like the one above seems like it must be over-simplifing the entire economy. But since this is frequently how mutual funds are designed, this graph has real value. It lets you know how funds are run.


## 2. Fees and Expenses

Mutual Funds can be a solid way to invest your money. But the companies that run mutual funds are for-profit businesses. Either up-front, or over time, mutual funds charge you money. And they can take a lot of your profits.

Mutual funds can charge you fees in lots of different ways:

* **shareholder fees** are incured during shareholder transactions (buying / selling)
* **operating costs** are due to paying the people that manage the fund

![Beware Fees](/assets/images/invest/mutual_fund_fees_ex.png)

A good rule-of-thumb is:

> Don't pick funds that charges more than 0.25% in fees.

Fees and expenses are tricky. Dis-honest fund advertising will try to convince you that their fund makes so much money they can charge you 2%. Don't be fooled. For a neutral opinion on the fee structures of funds, the SEC is a safe source of information:

* [Secondary SEC page on Feeds and Expenses](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answersmffeeshtm.html)


## 3. Diversify Your Investments

> All investments involve risk.

Standard wisdom in investing is that you need to diversify your assets. The market will ebb and flow, and when one investment dips you don't want to lose everything. Don't put all your money in [Dutch Tulips](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp).

Mutual funds seem like a good answer to this. By definition, they help you diversify where is invested. And if we look at the "Cap vs Growth Graph" above we see an easy way to start thinking about diversifying our assets even further. We can pick different corners of the "Cap vs Growth" graph.


## 4. A Final Note: Index Funds

An [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) (also index tracker) is a mutual fund designed to follow certain preset rules so that the fund can track a specified basket of underlying investments, like the S&P 500. These funds are run on very strict rules and require for lower operating costs.

> The question is: are [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/fund-guide/mutual-funds-etfs/mf/default.aspx) really better than just a simple index fund?

There is an interesting story where [Warren Buffet bet](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp) a million dollars to any [hedge fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) on Wall Street that they couldn't earn more interest than a simple [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) over the next 10 years. Warren Buffet won the bet.

Of course, [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/fund-guide/mutual-funds-etfs/mf/default.aspx) are not [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp):

* [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) are much more aggressive in their investments
* [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) require a certain net worth to be able to invest

But this is a great example of the risk-vs-reward trade-offs. Most people believe index funds of the American economy have low risk in the long term.
