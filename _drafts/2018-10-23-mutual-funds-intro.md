This is just a quick intro to mutual funds; the kinds of beginner things I learned while researching for my own personal investing.


## Point 1: Diversify Your Investments

> Risk vs Return

Mutual funds usually list themselves as [Small Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp), [Mid Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp), or [Large Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp). The "Cap" there is market capitalization. Big companies like Google and Coca-Cola are "Large Cap". If a company . (In order to count as Small Cap a company needs $300 million capitalization, $2-$10 billion or Mid Cap, and over $10 is Large Cap.)

The idea here is one of risk. The standard wisdom is that Coca-Cola is such a big company that the chances of it's stock being worth $0 next year is virtually zero. But a smaller company (like that local restaurant down the street) *could* actually go out of buisness. So larger companies are seen as less risky.

## Point 3: Index Funds aren't Sexy, but Work

I won't be putting all my money in Index Funds or anything, but this is a *really* interesting point.
