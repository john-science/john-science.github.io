This is just a quick intro to mutual funds; the kinds of beginner things I learned while researching for my own personal investing.


## 1. Diversify Your Investments

> Risk vs Return

Mutual funds usually list themselves as [Small Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp), [Mid Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp), or [Large Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp). The "Cap" there is market capitalization. Big companies like Google and Coca-Cola are "Large Cap". If a company . (In order to count as Small Cap a company needs $300 million capitalization, $2-$10 billion or Mid Cap, and over $10 is Large Cap.)

The idea here is one of risk. The standard wisdom is that Coca-Cola is such a big company that the chances of it's stock being worth $0 next year is virtually zero. But a smaller company (like that local restaurant down the street) *could* actually go out of buisness. So larger companies are seen as less risky.

Mutual funds are frequently broken into "value" or "growth" categories, or "blend" which is a mix of the two. A "value" fund is one that is "cheap" right now, when compared with it's past earnings and reasonable estimates of its current evaluation. A "growth" fund is one that is currently growing really fast and is likely to yield some profits in the very near term. A "blend" fund takes stocks from both of these categories.

The general philosophy is that growth funds can yield higher profits, but in return for also having more risk involved.

Now that we have those two sets of terms defined we can look at our first risk vs reward chart.

The idea here is that a "Small Cap, Growth Fund" tends to take on more volatile stocks, which can mean greater profits but also greater losses. That is the risky corner of the graph. But "Large Cap, Value Funds" are much more stable in the long-term, in theory, and so they on the safe but low return corner of the graph.

This is the simplest way to think of the "risk vs reward" problem in Mutual Fun Investing. Do I trust it as the God's-honest truth? No. But mutual funds tend to be designed around these terms, and that makes this a useful way to think about mutual funds.


## 2. Watch out for Fees and Expenses

Mutual Funds can be a solid way to invest your money. But the companies that run mutual funds are for-profit businesses. And many of them will try and take a large portion of your profits in various ways. Either up-front, or over the years, mutual funds can charge you money in a lot of ways. If you're going to be be putting away a good portion of your money in mutual funds, it is worth your time to learn about the ways these companies can charge you.

## 3. Index Funds

> The question is: are [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/fund-guide/mutual-funds-etfs/mf/default.aspx) really better than just a simple [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp)?

There is an interesting story where [Warren Buffet bet](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp) a million dollars to any [hedge fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) on Wall Street that they couldn't earn more interest than a simple [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) over the next ~9 years. Warren Buffet lost the bet.

Of course, [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/fund-guide/mutual-funds-etfs/mf/default.aspx) are not [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp):

* [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) are much more aggressive in their investments
* [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) require a certain net worth to be able to invest

But this is a great example of the risk-vs-reward trade-offs. Most people believe index funds of the American economy have low risk in the long term.
