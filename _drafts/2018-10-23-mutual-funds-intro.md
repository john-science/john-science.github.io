## 0. What is a Mutual Fund

A mutual fund is a managed portfolio of stocks and investments that is curated for you using a stated, disciplined investment strategy.


## 1. Risk vs Return

#### Small Cap vs Large Cap

Mutual funds usually list themselves as [Small Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/small-cap.asp), [Mid Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/midcapstock.asp), or [Large Cap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/large-cap.asp). The "Cap" is short for market capitalization. (In detail, To count as Small Cap a company needs $300 million capitalization, $2-$10 billion or Mid Cap, and over $10 is Large Cap.) So, when you hear "Large Cap" think Coca-Cola and Google.

The idea here is larger companies are less risky. The standard wisdom is that Coca-Cola is such a big company that the chances of it's stock being worth $0 next year is virtually zero. But a smaller company (like that local restaurant down the street) *could* actually go out of buisness suddenly. So larger companies are seen as less risky.

#### [Value vs Growth](https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/9534/mutual-fund-types-value-vs-blend-vs-growth)

Mutual funds are also frequently broken into "value" or "growth" categories (or "blend" which is just a mix of the two). A "value" fund is one that is "cheap" right now, when compared with it's past earnings and reasonable estimates of its current evaluation. A "growth" fund is one that is currently growing really fast and is likely to yield some profits in the very near term. A "blend" fund takes stocks from both of these categories.

The general philosophy is that growth funds can yield higher profits, but in return for also having more risk involved.

#### The Graph

Now that we have those two sets of terms defined we can look at our first risk vs reward chart.

The idea here is that a "Small Cap, Growth Fund" tends to take on more volatile stocks, which *can* mean greater profits but definitely means greater risk. Conversely, "Large Cap, Value Funds" are much more stable in the long-term. Again, in theory. 

On the surface, a graph like the one above seems like it must be over-simplifing the entire economy. But since this is frequently how mutual funds are designed, this graph has real value. It lets you know what the fund managers are thinking.


## 2. Fees and Expenses

Mutual Funds can be a solid way to invest your money. But the companies that run mutual funds are for-profit businesses. And many of them will try and take a large portion of your profits. Either up-front, or over the years, mutual funds can charge you money in a lot of ways. If you're going to be be putting away a good portion of your money in mutual funds, it is worth your time to learn about the ways these companies can charge you.

## 4. Diversify Your Investments

> All investments involve risk.

Standard wisdom in investing is that you need to diversify your assets. The market will ebb and flow, and when one investment dips you don't want to lose everything. Don't put all your money in [Dutch Tulips](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp).

Mutual funds seem like a good answer to this. By definition, they help you diversify where each dollar you invest goes. And if we look at the graph above we see an easy way to start thinking about diversifying our assets even further...

## 5. A Final Note: Index Funds

> The question is: are [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/fund-guide/mutual-funds-etfs/mf/default.aspx) really better than just a simple [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp)?

There is an interesting story where [Warren Buffet bet](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030916/buffetts-bet-hedge-funds-year-eight-brka-brkb.asp) a million dollars to any [hedge fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) on Wall Street that they couldn't earn more interest than a simple [index fund](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) over the next ~9 years. Warren Buffet lost the bet.

Of course, [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/walkthrough/fund-guide/mutual-funds-etfs/mf/default.aspx) are not [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp):

* [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) are much more aggressive in their investments
* [hedge funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hedgefund.asp) require a certain net worth to be able to invest

But this is a great example of the risk-vs-reward trade-offs. Most people believe index funds of the American economy have low risk in the long term.
