summary: Installing a Pi-Hole on my home network, with Comcast and a Raspberry Pi.

{% include JB/setup %}

A Pi-Hole will protect your entire network from advertising and will go a long way towards helping defend you against malware and the ubiquitous internet giants tracking your life. It does this by blocking the IP address of all the advertising websites out there, so you don't see all those ads on your screen. This is great because it will protect your phones and tablets too, in positions where it is normally quite hard to install security apps and the like.

This will be a description of my personal install process. I am a typical American end-user, stuck using Comcast Xfinity for my ISP and with 3-5 internet-enabled devices in my home at any one time.


## Setting up the Raspberry Pi

* **Step 1** Get a Raspberry Pi. (Version 2 or newer preferred for performance.

I choose a Pi version 3B last year. I also apparently lost the power cable, so this project got put on hold for a couple days while I waited for a new one to arrive.
