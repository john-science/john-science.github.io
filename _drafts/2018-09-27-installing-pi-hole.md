summary: Installing a Pi-Hole on my home network, with Comcast and a Raspberry Pi.

{% include JB/setup %}

A Pi-Hole is a tool to filter out all internet traffic from your network that is ad-related. It does this by filtering out IP addresses known to be related to ads, information tracking, or malware.

This page will be an example walk-through of my installation experience, along with some retrospective on life behind a Pi-Hole.

I am a typical American end-user, stuck using Comcast Xfinity for my ISP. I have 3-5 internet-enabled devices connected to my home network at any one time. And I will be doing this installation from a Linux computer (though that won't matter much).


## Setting up the Raspberry Pi

* **Step 1** Get a Raspberry Pi. (Version 2 or newer preferred for performance.

You will also need a small set of peripherals for your Raspbery Pi: a power cable, an SD card, and optionally a case.

* **Step 2** Install an operating system on your Pi.

To do this, you will need an SD card reader, the ability to format your SD card, and the a disk image utility.
