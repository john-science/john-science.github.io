AWK is a Turing-complete language. So let's dive in.

The approach I'm going to take here it to introduce all the major language features via example. So, no, this isn't a complete language reference. If you want that, look [here](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html).


## Awk vs Mawk vs Gawk

There are various flavors of `awk`.

If you're nearly any flavor of linux, `awk` almost certainly comes installed. Try typing "`man awk`" to see what flavor of awk you have. You probably have MAWK or GAWK (GNU AWK). They have a very similar API and both are fine. I *think* GAWK is somewhat more consistent across versions and platforms.


## Example 1 - Field Separators

For our first example, let's parse a little CSV file. This one shows the radiation dosage from various sources in different units (`rad.csv`):

    source,dose (Sv),dose (BED)
    eating a banana,1.0E-7,1
    arm x-ray,1.0e-6,10
    dental x-ray,5.0e-6,50
    one day natural background,1.0e-5,100
    flight from LA to New york,4.e-5,400
    mammogram,4e-4,4000
    head CT scan,2.0e-3,20000
    chest CT scan,7.0e-3,70000
    max yearly radiation worker dose,5.0e-2,5e5
    lowest yearly dose linked to cancer,0.1,1e6
    usually fatal dase,4.0,4e7

Let's say we just want the first column of the file. We can get that on the commandline super easy:

    $ awk -F, '{print $1}' rad.csv
    source
    eating a banana
    arm x-ray
    dental x-ray
    one day natural background
    flight from LA to New york
    mammogram
    head CT scan
    chest CT scan
    max yearly radiation worker dose
    lowest yearly dose linked to cancer
    usually fatal dase

Or, let's just say we don't care about the hard numbers and we just want the Banana Equivalent Dosages (BED). So, we want the first and third columns:

    $ awk -F, '{print $1   $3}' rad.csv
    eating a banana   1
    arm x-ray   10
    dental x-ray   50
    one day natural background   100
    flight from LA to New york   400
    mammogram   4000
    head CT scan   20000
    chest CT scan   70000
    max yearly radiation worker dose   5e5
    lowest yearly dose linked to cancer   1e6
    usually fatal dase   4e7
