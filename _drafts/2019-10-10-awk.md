AWK is a Turing-complete language. So let's dive in.

The approach I'm going to take here it to introduce all the major language features via example. So, no, this isn't a complete language reference. If you want that, look [here](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Awk.html).


## Awk vs Mawk vs Gawk

There are various flavors of `awk`.

If you're nearly any flavor of linux, `awk` almost certainly comes installed. Try typing "`man awk`" to see what flavor of awk you have. You probably have MAWK or GAWK (GNU AWK). They have a very similar API and both are fine. I *think* GAWK is somewhat more consistent across versions and platforms.


## Example 1 - Field Separators

For our first example, let's parse a little CSV file. This one shows the radiation dosage from various sources in different units (`rad.csv`):

    source,dose (Sv),dose (BED)
    eating a banana,1.0E-7,1
    arm x-ray,1.0e-6,10
    dental x-ray,5.0e-6,50
    one day natural background,1.0e-5,100
    flight from LA to New york,4.e-5,400
    mammogram,4e-4,4000
    head CT scan,2.0e-3,20000
    chest CT scan,7.0e-3,70000
    max yearly radiation worker dose,5.0e-2,5e5
    lowest yearly dose linked to cancer,0.1,1e6
    usually fatal dase,4.0,4e7
