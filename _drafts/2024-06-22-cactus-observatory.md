### Force me to drive 7 hours (each way) for a 5-minute meeting

It was 43C (110F) in the shade, because of course it was. I had sweat completely through my t-shirt. It was black, cotton, and said "Talk Nerdy to Me" on it. On better days it was my favorite t-shirt, that day it was disgusting. It was the end of a long day of fixing engines and electronics and I was tired. My phone rang and when I checked the little screen on the outside it said Professor M was calling. I got excited to tell him about the day's progress and answered quickly.

"Ah, you're there, good," he said when I picked up the phone.

"Yeah, I'm finishing up the day. I made a lot of progress today! I managed to get six more mirrors," I began.

"Good. Good. Listen, I need you to come to a meeting on Friday," he interupted. 

"What? Wait, a meeting in Davis? That's a seven-hour drive," I said, followed by a stunned silence where I gathered my thoughts.

"Yeah, it's a meeting for the CACTUS research team. You HAVE to be there. You're the newest member of the team, and the newest grad student, and you can tell us all what the situation is like before we all drive all the way down there in a month," he said, quickly. It did not sound like he expected or would allow any argument. I was silent for a while.

"Okay, listen, here's the deal," I started. "It is 43 degrees out," I said, doing some math, because I knew he had grown up using the Metric system in India. "My car doesn't have air conditioning, and it's a seven-hour drive," I continued, talking fast, so he wouldn't interupt me again. "It would take two full days for me to do the drive, and I can't really afford to rent a hotel room once I get there. If all you want is a status update, I can email one, or give it over the phone," I finished. It was, I thought, a well-reasoned argument.

"No, this meeting is Important," he said, carefully pronouncing the capital I. "You have to come."

I was silent for a minute. For the next three months, he was my only employment. I needed the money to get me to the Fall when grad school started. I also wanted him to be my thesis advisor, so I could not afford to get on his bad side.

"It's not optional. The meeting is at 9:30AM on Friday. Be there. Bye," he said and hung up.

I looked around. I was alone on an industrial site, probably 7km from the nearest living person. Grad school would start in three months and I already had an advisor on the hook; this was good for me. In a better run universe a tumbleweed would have blown by. But I looked over and the chain link fence that surrounded the facility was still covered in tumbleweeds that had blown across the desert and had gotten stuck in the links. Shit. There was nothing for it, I would have to make the drive.

The next two days were about the same as usual. I killed a couple dozen black widows, but I ran out of bug spray so I was using the engine degreaser I used on the big motors that ran the mirrors. It orange and foamed up when you sprayed it, and it had a distinctly toxic smell to it. I was really happy with my discovery. Unlike bug spray that killed the bugs _eventually_, with the engine degreaser you would see the spiders disolve right before your eyes.

Thursday morning I got started later than I had wanted. I realized too late it was a bad idea to leave all my worldly posessions in the dirty motel my advisor paid rented for me. So, again, I packed every single thing I owned into a 20-year-old, compact vehicle. It was a challenging game of Tetris that took most of the morning. By the time I was done, the sun was up, it was hot, and I was already sweating.

But there was nothing for it. I got into the little car, which was riding dangerously low to the ground. When I sat back into the drivers seat, my back was already wet against the seat.

Because I got started late, the drive took me through the hotest part of the day. Through the Mohave Desert, and all the way along the San Juaquin Valley; this was probably the hottest drive I could have done through California in Summer. Without AC, I rolled both my windows down enough to get a breeze going. But I found I-5 was filled with semi-trucks in the middle of the work day. I ended up having to choose between a stifling hot box of a car with no breeze, or rolling the window down and having a breeze of diesel exhaust. I tried to distract myself with the stereo, but out in the farm country all I found was evangelical sermons and annoying talk radio.

By the numbers, the drive took about seven hours. But it felt longer. It felt like my personal purgatory; an eternal punishment for a lifetime of sins.

I turned off the radio. That helped a little.

By the time I drove into Davis, I was desparate to get out of the tiny, dry oven that was once a car. I got lost in town trying to find where I was going, and found myself screaming at the slow neighborhood traffic in front of me.

Peter, one of the older graduate students had told me I could sleep at his place for the night I was in town. He said he never stayed there anyway; he would be at his girlfriend's house. It was free, and I was grateful. It took a couple confused, tired hours to find his apartment, talk to him and get the keys. The sun was going down when he left me alone in his apartment.

I went upstairs to his "loft bedroom" and there was a large, circular dog bed on the floor.

Even this tired, part of me knew it was pointless to walk downstairs and look for another "loft bedroom", but I did it anyway. Nope, no other bedroom. It was a one-room studio with a loft. There were no other rooms at all. Parts of my brain reminded me that he talked an awful lot about "always staying at his girlfriend's place". Judging by the over-sized dog bed with a single pillow and a blanket on the floor, I expect they were getting pretty serious and would be married soon.

It turned out later, I was right. They were married within a year. They only kept the second apartment so their parents did not think they were living together before marriage.

I found it was hard to sleep in a round bed. And I found the pillow also smelled like dog. But it could not have mattered less; I slept like the dead.
