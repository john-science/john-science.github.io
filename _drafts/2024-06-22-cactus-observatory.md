### Traveling to Barstow

TODO: Edit: The story isn't mean to be about ME. Maybe this isn't where it starts. Maybe it should start in Barstow.

> Earth, 2004

I had just graduated college in Texas, and was moving off to physics graduate school in California. I was excited to learn the deep secrets of the universe that I could not learn with mere undergraduate physics classes.

I was packing eveything I owned into a compact-sized car to move to California. My little Ford Probe was 15 years old and did not really have a trunk. So I folded the back seats down and played a 4-hour game of Tetris, getting as many things as possible into the car.

It was a 21-hour drive from Austin to the observatory in Barstow and my car had no air conditioning. It was June, and I would be crossing the Chihuahuan Desert, the Sonoran Desert, and the Mojave Desert.

I determined that I could make the drive in two days. And I was too broke to pay for a hotel, so I would just sleep in my car for one night. I would find somewhere off the highway, in the desert, and just sleep in the driver's seat. The other seats would be full, of course. I was not looking forward to the drive. The only thing I had to look forward to was Carlsbad Caverns. They were eight hours from Austin, so I should be able to see them on the first day, and then find somewhere nearby to sleep.

I packed the car the night before, and crashed at a friend's place.

I woke up bright and early, to get started driving before it got hot. As I drove out of Austin I was sad to see it go. And I felt homeless and unanchored. But excited too.

The first eight hours of the drive were through West Texas. If you have never done this, imagine one of those scenes in an old Western movie with the tumbleweeds rolling across a dry barren landscape. Now imagine that for eight hours.

It was a long first day on the road, but as soon as I left Texas I saw signs for Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Suddenly I was excited again. I was on vacation. I had never been in a big cave, and these were supposed to be some of the most beautiful caves in the world. And, more importantly, they should be cold and dark after the desert heat baking me all day.

I got to the caverns for the last tour of the day. I was sweaty, tired, thirsty, and my eyes were dry, but I got there. I stood in line to buy my tickets, looking at the amazing, otherworldly photos of strange rock spires. I realized my eyes were actually really dry and bothering me. But I powered through and got a ticket. And I took the elevator down 230 m (750 ft) down, with my small tourist group.

The first thing that happened when the long elevator ride was over is both my contacts popped out. And the park ranger wouldn't take me back up the elevator. So I was stuck, blind, in the dark. Eventually, two little old ladies took me by the hand and lead in a half hour tour of the caverns. I couldn't see anything, and tripped a couple times, but they really tried their best. Eventually, when they were done with their own tour, they took me back up the elevator and we left. My glasses were in the car.

The caverns were closed for the day behind me, and I had a long drive the next day, so I never got to see the Carlsbad Caverns.

I drove out of the national park and a bit down the highway until it got dark, and I pull off on a dirt road and slept. The car was too full to put the driver's seat down at all, so I slept sitting up.

### Arriving in Barstow

> TODO: Clean up audio notes

In 2004 I got my undergradatue in physics in Texas and got into a graduate school in California. I needed a job for the summer, and found one at an observatory a professor in my new graduate department ran. I was thrilled. Sure, I really needed the money to get through the summer, but I was starting graduate research before I had even started graduate school.

The observatory was a strange high energy physics experiment, built out of an old experimental solar power plant in the desert outside Barstow. I had never heard of anything like it. And that was exciting. Moving off to physics graduate school surely meant learning deep truths about the universe that you just could not learn in undergraduate. And here was this strange experiment that made no sense; I was going to be learning strange new things. I could not have been happier.

I mean I could have been a little happier; I had to make the 21-hour drive from Austin, Texas to Barstow, California in June in a car with no air conditioning. I had to drive through the Chihuahuan Desert, the Sonoran Desert, and the Mojave Desert to get there.

Excited as I was, I still felt kind of homeless as I packed everything I owned into a compact car and set out on the drive.

When I got to Barstow, the observatory gate was locked, so I called Professor A who said he would not be there for two or three weeks. He told me to call the maintenance guy, who would show me what needed to get done in the mean time.

In high spirts, I called the maintenance guy, Jon, and he told me to meet him at the Super Walmart in town. So I drove the 30 minutes back from the observatory, and waiting in the parking lot. A couple hours later Jon showed up in an old pick-up truck. He was clearly a retired man, who only did maintenance on the observatory to keep busy. In new jeans and an old t-shirt, he was drinking Coke from a Big Gulp. As the Summer went on, I noticed he drank four Big Gulp's a day.

We made our introductions and small talk. He had me follow him in my car back out to the observatory. He unlocked the gate and gave me a key. I was amazed that on my first day I would have one of the only keys to a several million-dollar facility. I swelled with pride. Later on, I considered this a red flag. Not the first.

I saw the CACTUS observatory for the first time, and it was not like any other observatory in the world.

At the center there, there is a 100 meter (300 foot) tower, all simple metal grating staircases with a single white room on top. Around that, for a couple kilometers (1 mile) in every direction are 6m x 6m (20 ft x 20 ft) mirrors on big pedestals. Originally, the site was a solar power research facility, where they would focus the blistering desert sunlight on a water tank at the top of the tower to generate electricity. But, apparently, that research did not pan out. So it had been converted into a giant telescope. It was run at night, using the 2,000 mirrors to focus on a giant telescope in the top of the tower.

But they were not studying astronomy. But high energy particles that from deep space that hit the upper atmosphere and cause a thing called a Chernkov Shower.

At least, that was the goal. The mirrors had been rotting in the desert for 30 years; baking in the heat. And everything was broken. Each giant mirror was driving by a giant motor that needed maintenance. And every pedestal that held up a mirror was just a tall, steel tube with an access panel to an electronics control box. Every control box needed to be checked, and all of them needed repairs from minor maintenance, to a good hour soldering on replacement components.

I quickly found out this was going to be a long summer full of manual labor, alone in the desert heat. It was not what I thought learning the deep secrets of the universe looked like. It seemed like I would not do any studying over the summer. But I had to start somewhere, so that was fine.

And I had a few weeks to learn the ropes, and make as much progress as I coule before the rest of the research group showed up to start helping.

### black widows and engine degreaser

> TODO: The observatory was basically a wildlife preserve. Every time you opened a tube, I learned therapy snakes or spider nests. The most common snakes and spiders. I'd see on site the black widows and rattlesnakes. I was told And so I got working and for a few hours, the maintenance guy showed me all the various ins and outs of fixing the electronics and the mechanical Motors that moved the arms.

### The Site Truck

The observatory has something we called the "site truck". If you were on site, and you needed to haul equipment around, you used the truck. It was just an old, white Ford truck. It was kind of small, and not fancy in any way. It also didn't have license plates. Or locks on the doors. And it had been permanently hot-wired so you didn't need a key to drive it. You just jumped in, turned the ignition by hand, and off you went.

It was really convenient for getting around the site. We treated it like a large golf cart, you just jumped in and off you went.

Of course, even golf carts usually have keys. And turn signals.

The students were told not to take the site truck off site for any reason. We were told, and all certainly believed, it could not get up to highway speeds, and it would be dangerous to try. Of course, the truck was not street legal, and we all wondered if it was stolen. I looked one day, and the VIN number had been scratched off.


### Meet the Prof

> TODO: He gets drunk and I have to drive him back.

> TODO: I did get the odd other student to help out now and then.

> TODO: Clean up audio notes

John the maintenance guy I had learned later. Have been there 30 years, Southern California, Edison, the power company had moved him there 30 years before him so he could Would be one of the many people who worked on the project when it was active.

00:25
But now, everyone else had left and the company just needed one person to stay behind to Make sure the place wasn't. Brand's actor, robbed to keep the fence and all the To do basic maintenance and watch over it and he was semi-retired. So that seemed fine for him because he had a house and a family nearby.

00:48
What I learned over the next few weeks though, was that John was not a full-time employee. He wasn't there, 40 or 60 hours by a week. Like, I was now he was just there, occasionally 20 hours a week, probably less one day a week. They didn't pay him to be full time and he didn't want to work full time.

01:05
He was semi-retired So, most days I learned, I would be out there alone. Just me. Seven miles, I'm sorry, seven kilometers from the nearest living person in any One Direction you could see just open desert. From the facility. But I would be out there. Tuning Motors. Pulling heavy equipment above my head.

01:29
So I could work on the motors because the motors were 15 feet up, five meters up. I'd be working on the electronics, need to make sure that I turned off the power before I did that. And it was just me out there alone and a place that felt increasingly like a post-apocalyptic and a post-apocalyptic Movie.

01:49
In a place that felt more post-apocalyptic with each passing day because all the equipment was old and ignored, there were signs that people had been here decades beforehand. But no, it had been since everything was decaying and rotting and the paint plagued in the Sun. Cactuses and plants grew up around things.

02:08
Nothing was well maintained, it was all decaying and old in the heat, especially anything the observatory didn't actually need. I pictured. Zombies walking out from behind. The mirror pillars or zombies attacking me while I was in the control building alone, which is funny. It's funny that I was worried about zombies because There were actual dangers out of this out of the site.

02:41
I ran into black widows and rattlesnakes every day. Every time I opened up one of the five meter tall, 15 feet, steel pillars, that house, the electronics that run the motor, the motor that the mirrors were set on top of every single time, there was something new inside of it, usually a black widow nest, usually a black widow, but sometimes rattlesnakes sometimes snake nests.

03:06
Sometimes rats nests but not rarely rats. Didn't do well in the heat. Sometimes there were snakes I'd never seen before. Spiders, had never seen before the occasional Brown recluse. Sometimes these things popped out at you, the moment you owned the little maintenance panel on the side of the steel pillar.

03:24
But sometimes not sometimes you'd have to put your hand in there and shine a flashlight around to see the snakes, the bottom or to see where the weird black widow's nests were. They're shaped like a little golf balls made of. Brown cotton candy. And sometimes the Black Widow nest would be dead and would be opened and empty and you wouldn't see anything.

03:49
But on a couple of occasions, I'd open up one of these little steel patches and there would be hundreds of little baby black widows waiting for me. Or I'd open up a panel and immediately hear the hiss like rattle of a rattlesnake. Sometimes things popped out at me but sometimes I'd open up a panel and there'd be nothing.

04:08
And then I'd pull out the electronics, main, the electronics control box, and open that and there'd be something inside the control box. Usually only spiders lived in the control box. At first, I'd never seen a black widow before aren't there. Angular kind of terrifying. Looking spiders, full of pure black.

04:30
Spiders with a red hourglass on them, like a super villain in a movie. Like a super villain in a comic book. But, And so at first, I I asked John the maintenance guy if we had any bug spray and he looked at me kind of surprised and said, oh, you know, Probably.

04:48
He went into one of the warehouse buildings that I'd never seen opened before and probably never so opened again and he found the only can of bug spray in the entire site. And in the first week, I used to talk about it because I was trying to kill these black widows.

05:01
When I opened the box, But they didn't die immediately and I had to get work done. So I had spray too much. Bug poison on them, trying to kill them and eventually they'd die. But after a while, of course, I ran out of the bug spray. But I did have engine Degreaser to fix the big motors engines.

05:21
The size of the size of a small car motor that was on the top of the 15 foot pillar. And sometimes I need to use engine Degreaser to get those parts moving. And so one day, I tried spraying a little engine Degreaser. Uh, control box panel that had a black widow on it and the Black Widow dissolved.

05:41
Dissolved in front of my eyes inside the orange foam that the engine Degreaser created. And that was an exciting Discovery for me because I would never run an of engine Degreaser. We always needed it around to fix the engines. I'm told people can get used to anything. What surprised me out there alone in the middle of the Blazing hot heat suddenly becoming An engine mechanic.

06:07
Fighting black widows and running away from rattlesnakes and learning all the different snakes, the Mojave Desert, and spending my time alone in some post-apocalyptic decayed industrial facility, What I learned, what I was surprised to learn was that you get used to anything pretty quickly. The first day Professor a arrived at the observatory was exciting for me.

06:30
I was finally going to meet someone who worked at the observatory Other than the maintenance guy and I was told he got there a day before ever. I was told everyone else was going to get there. The restroom I was told the rest of the team would get there the following day.

06:44
So the first day was just me and him. He showed me around how to, actually run the controls that moved the mirrors from the control tower, and he talked about physics. It was all really exciting and I showed him the progress, I'd made and I, I showed him the big list of which mirrors work and which didn't, and which ones I had done maintenance for this season and which ones I hadn't and what our progress was looking like, and what made a timeline would be, like, take the whole facility running, it wouldn't happen this summer?

07:10
I said, And uh, we did a little work together. He, he worked long hard hours. He was a middle-aged Indian, man. Two thin smoked like a chimney. Every time we and on the first day, I took him, he took me to the top to the Tower for the first time because there was a special key to get into the Telescope room at the top of the tower and he finally had the key and let me in But it's 300.

07:39
It was 100 meters from the desert floor to the top of this Tower and it was all steel. Grating staircases that wound around you could see straight down to the the ground underneath you. It was windy and cool up there though, which I liked In the in the hundred meters to the stop.

07:57
And when he finally took me up to the top of the oh man. Uh, go back and fix all this phrasing. When he took me to the top of When he took me to the top of the tower, for the first time he had to stop halfway up to have a cigarette.

08:16
I considered suggesting to him that stopping halfway up. To have a cigarette. Probably wasn't actually helping since the problem was. He wasn't able to breathe well enough to do this. Do the hike up to the stairs, the stairs. But I decided I didn't tell him. Even though he couldn't breathe that well.

08:36
And even though,...

### Force me to drive 7 hours (each way) for a 5-minute meeting

It was 43C (110F) in the shade, because of course it was. I had sweat completely through my t-shirt. It was black, cotton, and said "Talk Nerdy to Me" on it. On better days it was my favorite t-shirt, that day it was disgusting. It was the end of a long day of fixing engines and electronics and I was tired. My phone rang and when I checked the little screen on the outside it said Professor A was calling. I got excited to tell him about the day's progress and answered quickly.

"Ah, you're there, good," he said when I picked up the phone.

"Yeah, I'm finishing up the day. I made a lot of progress today! I managed to get six more mirrors," I began.

"Good. Good. Listen, I need you to come to a meeting on Friday," he interupted. 

"What? Wait, a meeting in Davis? That's a seven-hour drive," I said, followed by a stunned silence where I gathered my thoughts.

"Yeah, it's a meeting for the CACTUS research team. You HAVE to be there. You're the newest member of the team, and the newest grad student, and you can tell us all what the situation is like before we all drive all the way down there in a month," he said, quickly. It did not sound like he expected or would allow any argument. I was silent for a while.

"Okay, listen, here's the deal," I started. "It is 43 degrees out," I said, doing some math, because I knew he had grown up using the Metric system in India. "My car doesn't have air conditioning, and it's a seven-hour drive," I continued, talking fast, so he wouldn't interupt me again. "It would take two full days for me to do the drive, and I can't really afford to rent a hotel room once I get there. If all you want is a status update, I can email one, or give it over the phone," I finished. It was, I thought, a well-reasoned argument.

"No, this meeting is Important," he said, carefully pronouncing the capital I. "You have to come."

I was silent for a minute. For the next three months, he was my only employment. I needed the money to get me to the Fall when grad school started. I also wanted him to be my thesis advisor, so I could not afford to get on his bad side.

"It's not optional. The meeting is at 9:30AM on Friday. Be there. Bye," he said and hung up.

I looked around. I was alone on an industrial site, probably 7km (4 miles) from the nearest living person. Grad school would start in three months and I already had an advisor on the hook; this was good for me. In a better run universe a tumbleweed would have blown by. But I looked over and the chain link fence that surrounded the facility was still covered in tumbleweeds that had blown across the desert and had gotten stuck in the links. Shit. There was nothing for it, I would have to make the drive.

The next two days were about the same as usual. I killed a couple dozen black widows, but I ran out of bug spray so I was using the engine degreaser I used on the big motors that ran the mirrors. It orange and foamed up when you sprayed it, and it had a distinctly toxic smell to it. I was really happy with my discovery. Unlike bug spray that killed the bugs _eventually_, with the engine degreaser you would see the spiders disolve right before your eyes.

Thursday morning I got started later than I had wanted. I realized too late it was a bad idea to leave all my worldly posessions in the dirty motel my advisor paid rented for me. So, again, I packed every single thing I owned into a 20-year-old, compact vehicle. It was a challenging game of Tetris that took most of the morning. By the time I was done, the sun was up, it was hot, and I was already sweating.

But there was nothing for it. I got into the little car, which was riding dangerously low to the ground. When I sat back into the drivers seat, my back was already wet against the seat.

Because I got started late, the drive took me through the hotest part of the day. Through the Mohave Desert, and all the way along the San Juaquin Valley; this was probably the hottest drive I could have done through California in Summer. Without AC, I rolled both my windows down enough to get a breeze going. But I found I-5 was filled with semi-trucks in the middle of the work day. I ended up having to choose between a stifling hot box of a car with no breeze, or rolling the window down and having a breeze of diesel exhaust. I tried to distract myself with the stereo, but out in the farm country all I found was evangelical sermons and annoying talk radio.

By the numbers, the drive took about seven hours. But it felt longer. It felt like my personal purgatory; an eternal punishment for a lifetime of sins.

I turned off the radio. That helped a little.

By the time I drove into Davis, I was desparate to get out of the tiny, dry oven that was once a car. I got lost in town trying to find where I was going, and found myself screaming at the slow neighborhood traffic in front of me.

Peter, one of the older graduate students had told me I could sleep at his place for the night I was in town. He said he never stayed there anyway; he would be at his girlfriend's house. It was free, and I was grateful. It took a couple confused, tired hours to find his apartment, talk to him and get the keys. The sun was going down when he left me alone in his apartment.

I went upstairs to his "loft bedroom" and there was a large, circular dog bed on the floor.

Even this tired, part of me knew it was pointless to walk downstairs and look for another "loft bedroom", but I did it anyway. Nope, no other bedroom. It was a one-room studio with a loft. There were no other rooms at all. Parts of my brain reminded me that he talked an awful lot about "always staying at his girlfriend's place". Judging by the over-sized dog bed with a single pillow and a blanket on the floor, I expect they were getting pretty serious and would be married soon.

It turned out later, I was right. They were married within a year. They only kept the second apartment so their parents did not think they were living together before marriage.

I found it was hard to sleep in a round bed. And I found the pillow also smelled like dog. But it could not have mattered less; I slept like the dead.

### not gonna fight off a pack of wild dogs

It was early, but already sunny and warm. It was perfect weather, which isn't a good sign for 6AM; you could tell it was going to be a hot day. But the 25-minute commute from the motel to the observatory was painless. There was never any rush hour traffic way out here. I had been doing the same routine for three months, and was going through my morning on auto pilot. I stopped, got out of the car, unlocked the gates, drove in, stopped, locked the gates behind me, got back in the car, and drove to the central control building. Auto pilot.

When I drove up main door (the only door) to the control building there was a pack of wild dogs sitting out front.

I thought, "Okay, that's new. But how did they get past the gate? Okay there must be a hole in the chain link fence that surrounds the observatory. That's not a surprise, the facility is old and poorly maintained and has at least 4 km of chain link fence that have been sitting in the desert for 20 years. But, okay, I really like dogs. Not a big deal."

I honked my car horn, once, briefly.

All fifteen dogs completely failed to jump up and run away. Most of them continued napping.

So I drove a few feet closer to them and honked again, this time for longer.

One of the dogs that were pacing around looked at my briefly while pacing.

Okay. I remembered that there was definitely not a single other living soul with 7km (4 miles). I could lay on that horn all day an no one would notice.

So I drove a bit closer to them, careful not to run any of them over. And I really leaned on that car horn. It went on a really, really obnoxiously long time.

I expected them to run. They were feral though, maybe they would bark or snap or growl. Maybe their hackles would raise.

Nothing. The dogs did a great impression of pretending they couldn't hear me. Several of them were still pretending to be sleeping.

I was stumped.

They were clearly dogs. They were not wolves or coyotes.

I looked around. Maybe some meth head had brought a big pack of dogs into the facilty? I did not see any other cars around, and you would have to drive to get this far out into the desert.

I thought, "I could just get out and go to work. It would probably be fine. And I really need this job."

I thought some more. Mostly about how I was 35 km (20 miles) from the nearest hospital, and I was locked alone in a gated facility.

I absent-mindedly pressed the horn some more, but my heart wasn't really in it.

Then I remembered I could call the site maintenance guy. Great. Maybe this happened all the time, and he would have a better idea. So I got out my phone and called him.

Eventually he picked up.

"Hey Jon, it's John, out at Solar 2," I said, suddenly chipper.

"Oh, hey Jon. What's up? You burn the place down while I was gone?" he responded.

"Not yet. But, hey, I got out to here today and there is a pack of wild dogs blocking the entrance to the control building. Have you seen that before? I asked, more casual than I felt?

He laughed. "What? Like Coyotes?" he asked.

"No, no, just dogs. But there are like 15 of them, and I'm still in the car becuase they just aren't running off," I said. And waited for a response.

"Did you try honking the horn?"

"Yep. A lot, actually," I said. And laid on the horn as evidence. One dog might have noticed, but he also might have just been scratching himself.

"Huh. Nope, that's a new one on me," he said. My hopes sank.

"Okay, well, when you get in today, you'll get to see it for yourself," I said.

"Oh, sorry. No. I won't be coming in today. Or tomorrow. I'm in the city for a couple days," he said. I never found out if "the city" was Las Vegas or Los Angeles.

"Shit. Okay. Well, I'll figure something out. Sorry to bother you. Have a good time in the city," I said.

"No problem. No problem. I'm sure they'll run off sooner or later," he said. I took a look at the dogs, and they seemed pretty comfortable in the shade. I had my doubts.

We said our various good byes and hung up.

I honked the horn again while I was thinking.

The problem was I did not know where the hole in the fence was. I had spent 50-60 hours per week here for three months and I had never seen it. Maybe they just dug a new hole underneathe the fence. Either way, even if I could get them to run away, they were trapped in the facility with me. And they would need to decide to run out of the fence line. They could just as easily run far away from me and hide behind some equipment a few kilometers away where I could not see them.

I guess I could drive around the fence line, and look for the whole. Unless it was really obvious, that would take a couple of hours. Then, if I could find a way to chase them off, I just had to chase them toward the hole, and then block it behind them with something heavy.

I pictured what it would look like to try and chase 15 different dogs at the same time. Even in my imagination I looked stupid trying.

I hit the horn once for emphasis.

Eventually, I decided I would just call my advisor and tell him I am taking the morning off. I could come back after lunch, and hopefully they would have gotten bored and run off. I called the professor.

After four or five rings, he picked up. "Hello," he said. He sounded annoyed.

I made my tone as friendly and casual as I could, and said "Hey, Mani! It's John. I'm trying to get into the control room, but there is a pack of wild dogs gaurding the entrance. They aren't running off when I get close to them with the car or honk the horn. And Jon the maintenance guy isn't coming in for a couple days. So I think I'm going to take the morning off, and come back after lunch. If that's all right."

"Absolutely not. You are getting paid to work. Work," he said.

I thought about how I was getting paid for 20 hours a week and working 60 or 70, and was probably making about two dollars an hour. But I kept it to myself.

"Well, it's a pack of wild dogs. There's 15 of them. I'm not going to fight a pack of wild dogs," I said, in an appeal to reason.

"Run them over with the car, for all I care. But stop bothering me, I am a busy man. Go to work," he said, and hung up.

My thoughts were unprintable.

I looked at the dogs again, and thought I was probably over-reacting. It certainly seemed like they planned on ignoring me.

Then I thought about the summer I had spent working for Professor Asshole.

I decided to leave.

I turned the car around, and left. I did not have any money, but I had some books I could read back at the motel I could read. It would not be an exciting day, but in a week I would be leaving forever and making the seven hour drive to Davis one last time. I would be starting graduate school in physics, and my life would be totally different.


### copper pillaged, observatory shut down

> Correction: I actually went back out to Barstow a second summer. It was not the first winter but the second Took it all.

For reasons passing explaination, the observatory could only run in summer. In winter, the conditions just weren't right. So I went to class for the winter months, and spent my time in the lab preparing for the next summer. We ran simulations and models, and prepared for our next summer in observation. But towards the end of the summer we got the news.

The observatory had been destroyed.

You see, the observatory was outside the town of Daggett, California (population about 200), which was outside the city of Barstow, California (population about 20,000). But even further in the desert there was a little town called Yermo, California where the population might be anywhere from 100 to 1,000, depending on the time of year. Apparently, Yermo famously had a couple of transient communities known for producing methamphetamines.

And we left the site essentially unguarded for 6 months every year, and the locals all knew that. So, at some point during the winter, some meth heads got into the facility and spent at least days pulling out all the copper wiring. They particularly went for the big copper wires in the ground that ran from the control building to the mirrors.

They destroyed a 20 million dollar facility, and in the end only made a few hundred dollars.

It would have cost at least a million dollars to repair all the damage, since they just tore things apart at random to get the copper out. And our little project did not have the money.

I immediately realized that I had spent a year in a graduate program on a project that did not exist any more. So it would take me at least another year to graduate; I lost a year of my life.

Professor A took it pretty hard. The project was his baby, and it was gone. The second time in his career he had sufferred a serious blow. He did not come to campus much at all that summer. He drank himself into a heart attack at 48.
