> How well can you really know a man, if you don't even know his name?

That question is just a bit too timey-wimey for me. I want a number.

### The Doctor Who Quotient

Your Doctor Who Quotient (`Q`) is the number of complete stories you have watched divided by the total number possible (263):

    Q = (# stories you've seen) / 263

To find your `Q`, try this [calculator](/q.html).

### What is a Story?

Doctor Who has always been broken into "stories". That is, sometimes a single TV episode is a stand-alone story. But sometimes, particularly in the old days, five episodes in a row are part of a single, tightly-bound "story". These are how we measure your knowledge of the Doctor.

* [263](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_overview) TV stories were created, in total
* [155](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#First_Doctor) stories aired between 1964 and 1989
* [26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes) of the original 155 stories are at least partially lost
* [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_%28film%29) made-for-TV movie was made in 1996
* [107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Ninth_Doctor) stories have aired since the 2005 re-boot

### What's Your Quotient?

If you are a serious re-boot Whovian, and have been watching since 2005, your `Q` could be as high as:

    Q = 107 / 263 = 0.4  (serious)

A classic Whovian, who started watching religiously from 1964 to 1989 might have a `Q` as high as:

    Q = 155 / 263 = 0.59  (addict)

If you started watching Doctor Who today and got totally obsessed, you could watch all the stories except the lost 26. This could put your `Q` as high as:

    Q = (263 - 26) / 263 = 0.9  (wildly insane)

Find your quotient using [this handy calculator](/q.html).

### Is `Q` really a good metric?

Is `Q` a reasonable way to measure someone's knowledge of Doctor Who? That's certainly debatable, so let's go over the most common criticisms:

1. **Episodes, not Stories** - Perhaps we should measure `Q` based on episodes, not stories. It might be more fair to the 16 stories that are only partially lost. Honestly though, combing through 263 stories is enough work. Call us lazy, but digging through all 826 episodes is just too much work.
2. **Weights too heavily on the Reboot** - Most of the episodes since 2005 have been stand-alone stories. But in the Classic Who, most stories would take place over 4 or 5 episodes. This means that `Q` is weighted more heavily toward reboot episodes. On the other hand, classic episodes were only about 24 minutes long and reboot episodes have been more like 45 minutes, so it's not as bad as it could be.
3. **Other Media** - What about all of the Doctor Who content: audio tapes, comics, and books? Surely someone who has read every Doctor Who book is a bigger fan than someone who hasn't? True, but it's impossible to count every piece of non-Canonical Doctor Who lore. And it is even harder to weight the value of a book versus a TV episode in a way everyone will like, so let's not try.
4. **Shada** - Wait, [Shada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shada) isn't on the list! It was never completed or aired, so most people don't count it as an official story. Sorry.
5. **Season 23** - Wait, the entire of Season 23 is only one story? That's unfair! True, but the writers and producers say this is only one story ([The Trial of a Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord)). It doesn't get more official than that.

In the end, `Q` is only a useful measurement because there's no ambiguity. People have suggested other metrics over the years, but this is the easiest to understand. Best of all, calculating your `Q` means making a big list of all the Doctor Who episodes you haven't seen yet.
