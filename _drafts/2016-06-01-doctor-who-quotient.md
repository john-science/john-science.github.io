That question is just a bit too timey-wimey for me. I want a number.

### The Doctor Who Quotient

Your Doctor Who Quotient is the number of complete Doctor Who stories you have seen divided by the total possible (263):

    Q = (# stories you've seen) / 263

To find your Q, try the [calculator](/q.html).

### Facts

Doctor Who has always been broken into "stories". That is, sometimes a single TV episode is a stand-alone story. But sometimes, particularly in the old days, five episodes in a row are part of a single, tightly-bound "story". These are how we are going to measure your knowledge of the Doctor.

* [263](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_overview) TV stories were created, in total<sup>1</sup>
* [155](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#First_Doctor) stories aired between 1964 and 1989
* [26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes) of the original 155 stories are at least partially lost<sup>2</sup><sup> 3</sup>
* [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_%28film%29) made-for-TV movie was made in 1996
* [107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Ninth_Doctor) stories have aired since the 2005 re-boot

1. All data recent as of June, 2016.
2. The lost episode "Power of the Daleks" was [re-imagined on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCq5GsZHIgqknsvfwBT2rUNQ) by Nick Scovell in 2012.
3. Though not a missing episode (because it was never aired) [Shada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shada) is an incomplete episode that is available in various media.

### What's Your Quotient?

If you are a serious re-boot Whovian, and have been watching since 2005, your quotient could be as high as:

    Q = 107 / 263 = 0.4

If you watched every single episode of Doctor Who religiously when they first aired from 1964 to 1989, you would have seen the episodes that are lost today. That would put your (impressive) quotient at:

    Q = 155 / 263 = 0.59

If you are totally obsessed, and you hunt hard, you can watch all of the doctor who stories except the lost 26. This would put your insane quotient at a staggering:

    Q = (263 - 26) / 263 = 0.9
