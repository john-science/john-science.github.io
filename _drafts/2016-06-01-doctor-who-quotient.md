> How well do you know the Doctor?

How big a fan of the show are you? And I don't want some timey-wimey answer. I want a number.

### The Doctor Who Quotient

Your Doctor Who Quotient (`Q`) is the number of complete stories you have seen divided by the number possible (263):

    Q = (# stories you've seen) / 263

Find your `Q` using the [Q Calculator](/q.html).

### What is a Story?

Doctor Who has always been broken into "stories". Sometimes a single episode is a stand-alone story. But sometimes, particularly in the old days, five episodes in a row are part of a single, tightly-bound "story". These are how we measure your knowledge of the Doctor.

* [263](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_overview) TV stories were created, in total
* [155](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#First_Doctor) stories aired between 1964 and 1989
* [26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes) of the original 155 stories are at least partially lost
* [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_%28film%29) made-for-TV movie was made in 1996
* [107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Ninth_Doctor) stories have aired since the 2005 re-boot

### What's Your Quotient?

If you are a serious re-boot Whovian, and have been watching since 2005, your `Q` could be as high as:

    Q = 107 / 263 = 0.4  (serious fan)

A classic Whovian, who watched religiously from 1964 to 1989 might have a `Q` as high as:

    Q = 155 / 263 = 0.59  (addict)

If you started watching Doctor Who today and got totally obsessed, you could watch all the stories except the lost 26. This could put your `Q` as high as:

    Q = (263 - 26) / 263 = 0.9  (wildly insane)

To find your `Q`, try the [Q Calculator](/q.html).

#### Is `Q` a good metric?

Obviously, don't take `Q` too seriously. But is it a reasonable way to measure how big a Doctor Who fan you are? Everything's debatable, so let's go over some possible criticisms:

1. **Episodes, not Stories** - Should `Q` be based on episodes, not stories? It might be more fair to the 16 stories that are only partially lost. Fair point, but I'm lazy. Combing through all 263 stories is enough, going through all 826 episodes is just too much work.
2. **Reboot Weight** - Does `Q` weight too heavily on the reboot? Most of the episodes since 2005 have been stand-alone stories. But in the Classic Who, most stories took 4 or 5 episodes. However, classic episodes were only about 24 minutes and reboot episodes have been more like 45 minutes, so it's not as bad as it could be.
3. **Other Media** - What about all of the Doctor Who content: audio tapes, books, comics, etcetera? Surely someone who has read every Doctor Who book is a bigger fan than someone who hasn't? True, but keeping track of all that would be a lot of work. And I don't want to be drawn into a debate about how to weight a book versus a TV episode.
4. **Shada** - Wait, [Shada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shada) isn't on the list! Sorry. It was never completed or aired.
5. **Season 23** - Wait, the entire Season 23 is only one story? That's unfair! I agree. But the writers and producers said this was only one story ([The Trial of a Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_a_Time_Lord)). So it's officially unfair.

In the end, I built the [Q Calculator](/q.html) so I could make a big list of all the episodes I haven't seen yet.
