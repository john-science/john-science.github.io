If you own land, go ahead and plant a native tree. Hell, plant two. But for those of us who live in apartments, it's not an option to plant trees with our own hands. There are, however, people all around the world working on reforesting this planet. People who are working hard to fix the problems of the last 1000 years.

What I have below is a list of place you can feel good about donating to. They are trustworthy organizations that will spend your money wisely: planting native species, keeping biodiversity high, and supporting the local communities that desparately need access to the resources a healthy forest brings.

### How to Validate a Charity

> Try not to give to a charity that spends more than 25% of donations on overhead.

Here are some good resources to research a charity before you give:

* [GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org/) - has actual IRS forms for US charities
* [Wise Giving Alliance](https://www.give.org/)
* [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/)
* [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/)


## Donate Passively

> Plant trees by doing online searches.

Do you Google things a lot? Every time you search the internet, you generate revenue for that search engine. Why not use all that revenue to do something good for one? If you use the [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) search engine, 50% of the revenue you passively generate by searching online goes to planting trees around the world.

As a bonus, Ecosia cares a LOT more about your privacy than Google does.

## Guides for Planting and Growing your own Trees

If you *can* plant a tree yourself, awesome. Hell, plant one for me, I am intensely jealous.
