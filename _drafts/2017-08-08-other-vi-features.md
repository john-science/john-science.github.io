> Obviously, VIM has more features and is more powerful. But I have also found it a lot easier to get information on VIM. So this is just a quick post to flush out some of the features in VI that people don't use as often.

Combing through various manuals and cheatsheets, using "the other" features I have never used before or don't use often.  Trying them during "real work" to see what I like and what I don't.
