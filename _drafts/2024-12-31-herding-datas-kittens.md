Hello everyone. My name is John and today we're going to be talking about being a software leader for non-software staff. For the last 18 years. I've worked in physics and environmental engineering. Climate change, weather modeling, fire prediction.

00:28
Medical modeling and nuclear, engineering modeling scientific modeling. All kinds I've worked with data Engineers. I've worked with mechanical engineers. It's chemists forest. Firefighters Physicists nuclear Engineers meteorologists and assorted other smart people who because of the modern world wrote software every day as part of their job. But software was not what they loved.

00:57
It wasn't what they were educated on. It's not what they knew about. It's not really what they cared about. And so that's what we're here to talk about today. How would it be a leader, official or otherwise and we'll talk about how different kinds of leadership. For an advocate for good software practices for better software.

01:18
In a community of people who write software but are not software first Engineers, There are different kinds of leadership. So sorry, a backpack back. There are different kinds of leadership. Sometimes you can lead by being someone's manager. Having a group of people that work under you and passing down rules about how they need to work, or what they need to do, as part of their job, that's a type of leadership.

01:53
There are other types of leadership though. You can lead by example which is a great way to be and certainly if you want to be a software leader for non-software staff, you need to lead by example. But I think maybe even a better type of leadership for us to talk about today and the kind that I like the most is lead by helping people with their job, making their lives easier.

02:18
And by advocating for the best way to work. And so we're going to talk today about Various things that you can do. In any kind of leadership to help Drive the best quality code, quality software production out of your staff, If you work with smart people who are doing interesting things, and one of the things they do is write code regularly, if not every day.

02:54
And that code's important because it does something interesting. Maybe you are a software engineer but the people you work with, aren't they produce software as an output and that is Because of the modern world like they might produce mathematics when they balance their checkbook. I might use it as a tool, but they may not understand it.

03:19
And they different members of the smart people on your team. Might have. Different levels of understanding. And that's great. We love smart people. We love enthusiasm and energy and ambition. We love when they are doing something interesting. But the first thing to know is that not everyone is going to love software or think it's important.

03:42
So you're going to have to advocate. You're going to have to try to create A real environment where people learn important things about software. Another really important a beep, boop. An important idea to keep in mind. Is that everyone starts off at a different place. If you have a team of 10 or 100, or a thousand, smart people all writing software.

04:09
Some of them might be nearly professional software Engineers, some of them may barely know how to write a while loop. Educational topics. Technical debt. Code quality. Bugs. Quality assurance. Testing. Documentation. Building a Grassroots team colon acolytes for your own personal religion. Beep. Boop. Use AI to generate.
