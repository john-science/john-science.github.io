summary: The entire history of the Dwarves of Middle Earth.

{% include JB/setup %}

I recently took a deep dive into the history of Tolkien's Dwarves for a [game](https://github.com/theJollySin/mazes_of_erebor) I am writing. There is not as much known about the Dwarves as there is about the Elves, who were given the entire Silmarillion for their history. Instead, I had to scrounge information from all of Tolkien's works.

What follows are the Cliff's Notes for every major event we know of in Dwarven history. Text in italics is not explicitly stated in Tolkien's works, but can be inferred without too much imagination.


### Elder Days

These are the endless days before history.

* [Eru Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar) creates the gods [Ainur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainur_%28Middle-earth%29), with [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB) and [Melkor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgoth) among them.
* Melkor is the greatest of the Vala, but is overwhelmed by a desire for power.
* [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_%28Tolkien%29), the physical world, is created.
* Some Ainur descend into Arda to oversee it; they are known as the [Vala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vala_%28Middle-earth%29) (or Valar).
* Melkor claims Arda for himself; he becomes the source of all evil.
* Aulë, god of skill and craftsmanship, creates the [Dwarves](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves) in secret from the other Vala.
 * *This is probably why the Dwarves are the least corruptable of all races. During the creation of Elves and Humans, all of the Vala were present and played a part, including Melkor. But Melkor played no part in the creation of the Dwarves.*
 * It [appears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Jewels) Aulë created the Dwarven language, which did not change much over time.
* Ilúvatar finds out about the Dwarves, and tells Aulë to destroy them. But Ilúvatar stops Aulë from destroying them, and stipulates only that they must sleep until the [Elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf_%28Middle-earth%29) awake.

### First Age

This is a long period that starts before the Sun and Moon exist, but ends in the early written history.

* [Elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf_%28Middle-earth%29) are awakened by [Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar).
* [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) is originally a [Maia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maia_%28Middle-earth%29), or demigod servant, to [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB), but he is corrupted and becomes the chief lieutenant of [Melkor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgoth).
* Melkor captures Elves and begins breeding [Orcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc_%28Middle-earth%29) from them.
* The [Fathers of Dwarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_of_the_Dwarves) are first awakened by Ilúvatar during the [Years of Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Arda#Years_of_the_Trees), as are [Ents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent).
 * [Durin I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_the_Deathless), who was laid to rest alone, awoke first of all Dwarves.  [Mount Gundabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Mount_Gundabad) in the [Misty Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Mountains) was forever after sacred to the Dwarves for being where Durin first awoke.
 * Two Fathers were laid to rest in the Blue Mountains, and they founded the lines of the [Broadbeams](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Broadbeams) and the [Firebeards](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Firebeards) who later lived in [Nogrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Nogrod) and [Belegost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Belegost) respectively.
 * Four other Fathers were laid down in the far East. We know the least about these Dwarves, except that they arose in the [Orocarni](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Orocarni) Mountains and formed the clans [Ironfists](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ironfists), [Stiffbeards](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stiffbeards), [Blacklocks](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Blacklocks), and [Stonefoots](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stonefoots).
* Durin the Deathless founds [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29), where other Dwarves begin to gather.
* The Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost are met by the [Sindarian Elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindar), establishing trade.
* The Dwarves are the first to forge mail armor of linked rings. *Tolkien's works rarely involve plate armor, ignore the movies.*
* The Dwarves of Belegost and the Sindarian Elves build the great underground Elven city of [Doriath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doriath).
* The Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost build the great [Dwarf-road](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarf-road_of_Beleriand) to [trade](http://www.henneth-annun.net/events_view.cfm?evid=994) with Doriath and Beleriand.
* The [First Battle of Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Beleriand) is the first of the [Wars of Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#Battles_of_Beleriand) against Melkor. The Dwarves join the Elves and Men.
* -1: The moon rises for the first time.
* 1: The sun rises for the first time.
* 1: Humans are awakened by Ilúvatar in [Hildórien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Arda#Hild.C3.B3rien).
* c 60–200: Melkor is absent from his great fortress [Angband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband). Persuaded by Melkor, humans stop worshipping Ilúvatar and turn to evil, but some revolt: the Atanatári. Dwarves and Avari Elves aid these people in travelling West in search of the Vala. As divine punishment, humans lose the gift to die at will and are doomed to lead short life-spans at the end of which death takes them by force.
* 150: The Dwarves renew their trade with the Elves of [Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beleriand).
* 468: The Dwarves of Belegost join the [Union of Meahdros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maedhros) in in [Nírnaeth Arnoediad](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Nirnaeth_Arnoediad), the fifth battle of the [Wars of Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#Battles_of_Beleriand) against Melkor. King [Azaghâl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Azagh.C3.A2l) was slain but the [Glaurung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaurung), the first dragon, but not before he stabbed the beast in the stomach making to flee the battle.
 * *It seems likely that since the Dwarves were in the first and fifth of the Wars of Beleriand, they were in the others. But Tolkien only recounts the deeds of the Elves in those battles.*
* 502: King [Thingol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thingol) of Doriath invites the Dwarves of Norgrod to create jewelery in his vast treasury; of these works the necklace [Nauglamír](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_objects#Nauglam.C3.ADr) is their finest work.
* 503: King Thingol has the Dwarves set [Beren](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Beren) and [Lúthien](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/L%C3%BAthien)'s [Silmaril](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Silmaril) into Nauglamír, making it the fairest object in Arda. The Dwarves desire it and up slaying Thingol. They lie about what happened and return with an army from Norgrod to sack Doriath. Heavy with spoils on their march home, the Dwarven army is destroyed entirely by Elves and Ents in the [Battle of Sarn Athrad](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Battle_of_Sarn_Athrad). Beren gives the necklace to Lúthien.
* 545-587: [The War of Wrath](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/War_of_Wrath) between the Vala; after which most the world West of the [Blue Mountains](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Blue_Mountains) is sunk into the sea. Two great houses of Dwarves, Nogrod and Belegost, are destroyed; the survivors flee to Khazad-dûm.
* 590: Melkor is cast into the void.

### Second Age

The second age lasts 3441 years, and the Dwarven people are conspicuously absent from the affairs of the rest of the world.

* c 750-1500: The two greatest craftsman of the age, [Celebrimbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrimbor) the Elven Lord of Eregion and the Dwarf [Narvi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Narvi), build the [Doors of Durin](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Doors_of_Durin): the West gate of [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29). The gate were designed to aid the great friendship and trade between Dwarves and Elves.
* c 1500-1590: [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) the Deceiver gives [seven rings of power](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Seven_Rings) to seven Dwarf Kings.
 * It is likely that Celebrimbor gives Durin his ring, not Sauron.
 * Dwarves are not as easily corrupted as Elves or Humans. Their rings do not corrupt them; the wearers are given great power, though they become greedier.
 * Four of these rings are later destroyed by Dragons, and Sauron is able to retrieve two more during the Second Age.
 * *It is likely that one ring was given to the leader of each of the seven [Dwarven clans](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves#Origin).*
* 3430: [Durin IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_IV) joins the [Last Alliance of Elves and Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Last_Alliance) with an army of Dwarves in the fight against Sauron.
* 3434: The Last Alliance defeats Sauron's forces in the [Battle of Dagorlad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Last_Alliance); and the Siege of [Barad-dûr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barad-d%C3%BBr) begins.
* 3441: [Isildur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isildur) cuts the [One Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring) from Sauron's finger, ending the war.

### Third Age

The third age lasts 3021 years, and during this time the number of Dwarves on Arda begins to decline.

* 1980: Dwarven [mithril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril) miners in [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29) delve too greedily and too deep and awaken a [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog), which kills [King Durin VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_VI) and ever after the Dwarves call [Durin's Bane](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin's_Bane).
* 1981: Durin VI's son, [Nain I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#N.C3.A1in_I) is killed by the Durin's Bane, and Dwarves abandon Khazad-dûm; they start calling it Moria, meaning "Black Pit".
* 1999: After fleeing Khazad-dûm, [Thrain I](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_I) founds [Erebor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lonely_Mountain) and discovers the [Arkenstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_objects#Arkenstone).
* 2210: King Thorin I [leaves Erebor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Third_Age_2210), and goes north to the [Grey Mountains](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Grey_Mountains), where the remnants of Durin's Folk are gathering.
* 2570-2589: [The War of the Dwarves and Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Dragons) in the [Grey Mountains](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Grey_Mountains). The Dwarves lose and the survivors flee to resettle in Erebor and the Iron Hills.
* 2770: The fire drake [Smaug the Golden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaug) takes Erebor, killing many.
* c 2780-2790: After fleeing Smaug in Erebor, the Longbeards temporarily settle in the human town of [Dunland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Dunland) in the foothills of the [Misty Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Mountains).
* 2790: King-in-Exile [Thrór](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Thr.C3.B3r) leaves Dunland and enters Moria alone. Azog the Orc kills him, defiles the body, and mocks the Dwarves.
* 2790: [Nár](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/N%C3%A1r), servant of Thrór, brings word of Thrór's death back to [Thrain II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_II), his son. Thrain II does not eat or sleep for seven days, then declares war on the Orcs.
* 2790-2793: For the first time, all seven clans of Dwarves gather; to wage war on the Orcs.
* 2793-2799: [The War of Dwarves and Orcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Orcs) starts at [Mount Gundbad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Mount_Gundabad) in the North of the Misty Mountains and the Dwarves clear out every Orc stronghold to [Methedras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Methedras) in the South.
* 2799: The war ends at the Eastern gate of Moria with the [Battle of Azanulbizar](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Azanulbizar). Every Orc is slain, but at least half the Dwarves also die.
 * Azog kills [Náin Ironfoot](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/N%C3%A1in,_father_of_D%C3%A1in_Ironfoot), whose son [Dáin II Ironfoot](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/D%C3%A1in_II_Ironfoot) avenges him by killing Azog.
 * There are too many bodies to bury in stone tomes, so the Dwarves are burned in a great pyre. The decendants of those who died in Azanulbizar are honored as "sons of burned Dwarves".
 * After the battle, Dwarves see the Balrog in the gates of Moria, and turn back. They do not retake Moria. 
 * *This war set the stage for the [War of the Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Ring) (3018-3019). Without this (mostly underground) war, there would have been many more orcs in the Misty Mountains that could have attacked Gondor and Rohan from behind and divided their war into two fronts. It would also have made it nearly impossible to cross the Misty Mountains safely.*
 * *This war also accounts for why Dwarven numbers were already so small by the time of the War of the Ring.*
* 2845: [Thráin II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_II) was captured by [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron)'s forces and in the dungeons of [Dol Guldur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dol_Guldur) the last of the seven rings given to Dwarves was taken back.
* 2850: [Gandalf the Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf) finds [Thráin II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_II) insane and defeated after years of torture in Dol Guldur. Thráin gives Gandalf a map and a key to Erebor and asks him to give them to his son, though at the time Gandalf did not know who Thráin was.
* 2941: [Thorin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorin_Oakenshield), son of Thrain II, begins the [Quest of Erebor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quest_of_Erebor) with his close relations: Balin, [Fíli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#F.C3.ADli), [Kíli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#K.C3.ADli), [Glóin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gl%C3%B3in), [Óin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%93in), [Dwalin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Dwalin), [Dori](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Dori), [Nori](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Nori), [Ori](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Ori), [Bifur](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Bifur), [Bofur](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Bofur), and [Bombur](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Bombur). At the request of Gandalf, they invite the Hobbit [Bilbo Baggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins).
* 2941: Bilbo Baggins obtains the [One Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring) from the creature Gollum.

* 2941: Bilbo steals the Arkenstone and attempts to use it to forestall a war with Mirkwood Elves and Laketown Humans.
* 2491: Thorin, Fíli, and Kíli killed in [The Battle of the Five Armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#Battle_of_Five_Armies) along with Bolg son of Azog. Dáin II Ironfoot becomes King of The Lonely Mountain and recieves the Arkenstone. The town of Dale re-established by Bard.
* 2989: [Balin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balin_%28Middle-earth%29) takes a company of Dwarves to recolonize Moria. They succeed for a time, and even find [Durin's Axe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Durin.27s_Axe).
* 2994: King Balin is killed by an Orc arrow by outside Moria in [Dimrill Dale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Dimrill_Dale). His tome is built in his throne room; the [Chamber of Mazarbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29#Chamber_of_Mazarbul).
* 2994: The Orcs have far greater numbers and swiftly retake Moria; the Dwarves make their final stand in the Chamber of Mazarbul.
* 3017: Sauron sends a emissary to Erebor, seeking the One Ring and an alliance. Erebor stonewalls.
* 3018: [Gimli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_%28Middle-earth%29) and Glóin go to [Rivendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivendell) to find out what happened to Balin. There they learn that the One Ring has been found; Gimli joins the [Fellowship of the Ring](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Fellowship_of_the_Ring).
* 3019: Erebor and Dale are seiged by Orcs and Sauron's forces from the East. But they hold for a year; without which the War of the Ring could not have been won by the free peoples.
* 3019: The Fellowship enters Moria. Gimli learns the fate of his cousin Balin, of Moria, and sees Durin's Bane firsthand.
* 3019: Gandalf the Grey slays the [Durin's Bane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog#Durin.27s_Bane) and become Gandalf the White.
* 3019: While preparing for the [Battle of the Hornburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Hornburg), Gimli discovers the caves of [Aglarond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm's_Deep#Aglarond) underneathe the fortress of [Helm's Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm's_Deep).
* 3019: Sauron's One Ring is destroyed in Mount Doom.

### Fourth Age

Tolkien does not tell us much about the Fourth Age or beyond.

* c 1-100: The Dwarves of [Erebor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Mountain), [Gimli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_%28Middle-earth%29) in particular, rebulid and greatly improve the Human city of [Minas Tirith](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Minas_Tirith).
* c 20-120: Gimli returns to [Aglarond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm's_Deep#Aglarond) and founds a Dwarf colony there, where he is known as [Lord of the Glittering Caves](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lord_of_the_Glittering_Caves). 
* 120: [It is believed](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves#Fourth_Age) that Gimli, Son of Gloin, became the only Dwarf ever to cross the sea to the [Undying Lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aman_%28Tolkien%29).
* [Durin VII](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin_VII) (Durin the Last) led Durin's Folk back to [Khazad-dûm](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Moria) and restored the greatest kingdom of the Dwarves.
* Khazad-dûm and Erebor are the two great final kingdoms of the Dwarves. It is not clear if the Dwarves slowly diminish and are gone from the world or if they simply delve so deeply that they are never seen above ground again.


Fun Facts
---------

* Both male and female Dwarves are [born with full beards](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/40024/are-dwarfs-born-with-beards).
* Dwarves naturally live about 250 solar years.
* The Dwarves are secretive about their religion. *But it probably revolves around [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB).*
* The Dwarves are secretive about their language, and only one outsider has ever learned to speak it.
* *If you read that a Dwarf is "son of Thrain" or "father of Dain", don't assume they are male. Because of translation problems and the beards, Dwarves are usually referred to with male pronouns by outsiders.*
