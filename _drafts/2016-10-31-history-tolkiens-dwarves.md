{% include JB/setup %}

I recently took a deep dive into the history of Tolkien's Dwarves for a [game](https://github.com/theJollySin/mazes_of_erebor) I am writing. There is not as much known about the Dwarves as there is about the Elves, and there is no central tome like the Silmarillion to learn about the Dwarves. But there is information sprinkled throughout all of Tolkien's works that provide a broad history.

What follows are the Cliff's Notes for every major event we know of in Dwarven history. Text in italics is not explicitly stated in Tolkien's works, but can be inferred without too much imagination.


### Elder Days

The endless days before history began.

* [Eru Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar) creates the gods [Ainur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainur_%28Middle-earth%29), with [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB) and [Melkor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgoth) among them.
* Melkor is the greatest of the Vala, but is overwhelmed by the desire for power.
* [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_%28Tolkien%29), the physical world, is created.
* Some Ainur descend into Arda to over see it; they are known as the [Vala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vala_%28Middle-earth%29) (or Valar).
* Melkor claims Arda for himself; he becomes the source of all evil.
* Aulë, god of skill and craftsmanship, creates the [Dwarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_%28Middle-earth%29) in secret from the other Vala.
 * *This is probably why the Dwarves are the least corruptable of all races. During the creation of Elves and men, all of the Vala were present and played a part, including Melkor. But Melkor played no part in the creation of the Dwarves.*
 * It [appears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Jewels) Aulë created the Dwarven language, which did not change much over time.
* Ilúvatar finds out about the Dwarves creation, and tells Aulë to destroy them. But Ilúvatar stops him and the Dwarves are allowed to be, but must sleep until the [Elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf_%28Middle-earth%29) awake.

### First Age

These days start before the Sun and Moon exist, but end in the early written history when Melkor is expelled from Arda.

* [Elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf_%28Middle-earth%29) are awakened by [Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar).
* [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) is originally a [Maia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maia_%28Middle-earth%29), or demigod servant, to [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB), but he is corrupted and becomes the chief lieutenant of [Melkor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgoth).
* Melkor captures Elves and begins breeding [Orcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc_%28Middle-earth%29) from them.
* The [Fathers of Dwarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_of_the_Dwarves) are first awakened by Ilúvatar during the [Years of Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Arda#Years_of_the_Trees), as are the first [Ents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent).
 * [Durin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_the_Deathless) was laid to rest alone and awoke first of all Dwarves in [Mount Gundabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Mount_Gundabad) in the [Misty Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Mountains).
 * Two Fathers were laid to rest in the Blue Mountains, and they founded the lines of the [Broadbeams](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Broadbeams) and the [Firebeards](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Firebeards) who later lived in [Nogrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Nogrod) and [Belegost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Belegost).
 * Four other Fathers were laid down in the far East, and we know the least about their people's, except that they arose in the [Orocarni](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Orocarni) and formed the clans [Ironfists](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ironfists), [Stiffbeards](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stiffbeards), [Blacklocks](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Blacklocks), and [Stonefoots](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stonefoots).
* [Nogrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Nogrod) and [Belegost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Belegost) founded by Dwarves in the same long year as [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29) was founded by Durin the Deathless.
* The Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost are met by the [Sindarian Elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindar), establishing trade.
* The Dwarves of Belegost and the Sindarian Elves build the great underground Elven city of [Menegroth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doriath).
* -1: The moon rises for the first time.
* 1: The sun rises for the first time.
* 1: Humans are awakened by Ilúvatar in [Hildórien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Arda#Hild.C3.B3rien).
* c 60–200: Melkor is absent from his great fortress [Angband](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband), after discovering Humans. Persuaded by Melkor, humans stop worshipping Ilúvatar and turn to evil, but some revolt: the Atanatári. Dwarves and Avari Elves aid the people in travelling West in search of the Valar. As divine punishment, humans lose the gift to die at will, and are doomed to lead short life-spans at the end of which death takes them by force.
* 150: The Dwarves renew their trade in [Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beleriand).
* 502: Húrin brings the [Nauglamír](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_objects#Nauglam.C3.ADr) from Nargothrond to Thingol.
* 503: [Doriath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doriath) is sacked by Dwarves of Nogrod.
* 590: Melkor is into the void forever.

### Second Age

The second age lasts 3441 years, and the Dwarven people are conspicuously absent from the affairs of Elves and Humans during this time. *This suggests they were quite busy with something else.*

* c 750-1500: The two greatest craftsman of the age, the Elven Lord of Eregion [Celebrimbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrimbor) and Dwarf [Narvi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Narvi), build the [Doors of Durin](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Doors_of_Durin): the West gate of [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29). These gates were designed to aid the great friendship and trade between Dwarves and Elves.
* c 1500-1590: [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) the Deceiver gives [seven rings of power](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Seven_Rings) to seven Dwarf Kings.
 * It is likely that Celebrimbor gave Durin his ring directly, not Sauron.
 * Dwarves are not as easily corrupted as Elves and Humans. Their rings do not corrupt them; the wearers are given great power, though they are perhaps more greedy than they were.
 * Four of these rings were destroyed by Dragons, but Sauron was able to retrieve two more during the Second Age.
 * *It is likely that one ring was given to the leader of each of the seven [Dwarven clans](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves#Origin).*
* 3430: [Durin IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_IV) joins the [Last Alliance of Elves and Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Last_Alliance) with an army of Dwarves in the fight against Sauron.
* 3434: The Last Alliance defeats Sauron's forces in the [Battle of Dagorlad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Last_Alliance); and the Siege of [Barad-dûr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barad-d%C3%BBr) begins.
* 3441: Alongside Elves and Men, [Durin IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_IV) leads 50,000-60,000 Dwarves in the final battle of the Siege of Barad-dûr. [Isildur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isildur) cuts the [One Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring) from Sauron's finger, ending the war.

### Third Age

The third age lasts 3021 years, and during this time the number of Dwarves on Arda appears to decrease.

* 1980: Dwarven [mithril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril) miners in [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29) delve too greedily and too deep, and awaken the [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog) called [Durin's Bane](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin's_Bane), which kills [King Durin VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_VI).
* 1981: Durin VI's son, [Nain I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#N.C3.A1in_I) is killed by the Durin's Bane, and Dwarves abandon Khazad-dûm; they start calling it Moria, meaning "Black Pit".
* 1999: [Thrain I](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_I) founded [Erebor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lonely_Mountain) as the [Kingdom Under the Mountain](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kingdom_under_the_Mountain) after fleeing [Durin's Bane](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin's_Bane) in Khazad-dûm.
* 2210: King Thorin I [leaves Erebor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Third_Age_2210), and goes north to the [Grey Mountains](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Grey_Mountains), where the remnants of Durin's Folk are gathering.
* 2570-2589: [The War of the Dwarves and Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Dragons) was fought between the Dwarves of the [Grey Mountains](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Grey_Mountains) and the fire drakes from the Northern Waste. The Dwarves eventually lose and flee to resettle in Erebor and the Iron Hills.
* 2770: [Smaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaug) the dragon captured the great Dwarven city under the Lonely Mountain, killing many (or most) of the Dwarves that lived there.
* c 2780-2790: After fleeing Smaug in Erebor, the Longbeards temporarily settls in the human settlement of [Dunland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Dunland) in the foothills of the Misty Mountains.
 * [Thrór](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Thr.C3.B3r) is King, until his death, then his son [Thrain II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_II) is King-in-exile, and his son Thorin waits to be King.
* 2790: King Thrór enters Moria alone and is kill by Azog the Orc, who defiles his body and mocks the Dwarves.
* 2790: Nár, servant of Thrór, brings word of his death back to Thrain II, his son. Thrain II does not eat or sleep for seven days, then declares war.
* 2790-2793: The [Longbeards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Durin.27s_folk) gather fighting forces from all seven clans of Dwarves across the world, to re-take Moria.
* 2793-2799: [The War of Dwarves and Orcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Orcs) starts in the North of the Misty Mountains, and the Dwarves sweep South to Moria, clearing out every Orc stronghold as they go. The war is mostly underground.
* 2799: The Battle of Azanulbizar sets 6,000-10,000 Dwarves against Azog's 15,000-20,000 Orcs. The Orcs are killed to the last man, and the Dwarves lose at least half their numbers. For the first time, there are too many dead Dwarves to bury in stone tomes, so they are burned in a great pyre.
 * The decendants of those who died in Azanulbizar are honored as "sons of burned Dwarves".
 * After the battle, Dwarves see the Balrog in the gates of Moria, and turn back. They do not regain Moria after all. 
 * *This war set the stage for the [War of the Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Ring) at at the end of the Third Age (3018-3019). Without this (mostly underground) war, there would have been many more orcs in the Misty Mountains that could have attacked Gondor and Rohan from behind and divided their war into two fronts. It may also have made it nearly impossible to cross the Misty Mountains, and the ring may never have been recovered by a Hobbit.*
 * *This war also accounts for why Dwarven numbers were already so small by the time of the War of the Ring.*
* 2845: [Thráin II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_II) was captured by [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron)'s forces and in the dungeons of [Dol Guldur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dol_Guldur) the last of the seven rings given to Dwarves was taken back.
* 2850: [Gandalf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf) finds [Thráin II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_II) insane and defeated after years of torture in Dol Guldur. Thráin gives Gandalf a map and a key to Erebor and asks him to give them to his son, though at the time Gandalf did not know who Thráin was.
* 2859: Birth of [Fíli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#F.C3.ADli) son of [Dís](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#D.C3.ADs)
* 2864: Birth of [Kíli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#K.C3.ADli) son of [Dís](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#D.C3.ADs)
* 2879: Birth of [Gimli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_%28Middle-earth%29) son of Gloin
* 2941: Bard the Guardsman, man of Laketown, slew Smaug and freed the city of Erebor for Dwarves to live in again.
* 2941: [The Battle of the Five Armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#Battle_of_Five_Armies) was the battle that won Erebor back for the Dwarves. Though at some great cost to their numbers (probably thousands of Iron Hills Dwarves died in the battle).
* 2989: [Balin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balin_%28Middle-earth%29) takes a company of Dwarves to recolonize Moria. They succeed for a time, and even find [Durin's Axe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Durin.27s_Axe).
* 2994: [King Balin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balin_%28Middle-earth%29) is killed by an Orc arrow by outside Moria in [Dimrill Dale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Dimrill_Dale); his tome is built in his throne room; the [Chamber of Mazarbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29#Chamber_of_Mazarbul).
* 2994: The Orc force invading Moria has far greater numbers and re-takes Moria; the Dwarves make their final stand in the Chamber of Mazarbul.
* 3018: [Gimli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_%28Middle-earth%29) and [Glóin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Gl.C3.B3in.2C_son_of_Gr.C3.B3in) go to Rivendel to find out what happened to [Balin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balin_%28Middle-earth%29). There they learn that the [One Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring) has been found and Gimli joins the Fellowship of the Ring.
* 3019: [Gandalf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf) slays the Balrog [Durin's Bane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog#Durin.27s_Bane) in Moria.
* 3019: Sauron's One Ring is finally destroyed in Mount Doom.

### Fourth Age

* 120: [It is believed](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves#Fourth_Age) that Gimli, Son of Gloin, became the only Dwarf ever to cross the sea to the [Undying Lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aman_%28Tolkien%29).
* [Durin VII](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin_VII) (Durin the Last) led Durin's Folk back to [Khazad-dûm](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Moria) and restored the greatest Kingdom of the Dwarves, where they remained for as long as there were Dwarves in the world.


Fun Facts
---------

* Both male and female Dwarves are [born with full beards](http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/40024/are-dwarfs-born-with-beards).
* The Dwarves are secretive about their language and religion.
* Only one outsider has ever learned the Dwarven language.
* *If you read that a Dwarf is "son of Thrain" or "father of Dain", don't assume they are male. Dwarves are usually referred to with male pronouns.*
