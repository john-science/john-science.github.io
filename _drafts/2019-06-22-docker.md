It seems like Docker was an answer to the pains that came with virtual machines. Docker images are lighter weight in every way. It makes them better suited for bottling up your software for deployment. It means smaller images, and start up times in seconds instead of minutes. Maybe your image is a little less sandboxed than a full virtual machine, sure. But it's good enough.

Unlike a full virtual machine, a Docker image must have the same OS kernel as its host operating system. But that's it. It comes with the rest of the operating system it needs, along with the libraries and dependences for whatever app or tool is on the image. But because it shares the host system kernel, it is much smaller and takes longer to build than it otherwise would.

I figure the best way to learn Docker is to play around with it. So let's do that.


## Commandline

Docker comes with a powerful commandline tool. Though I've never found it to be particularly well-organized, so let's play with it.

## Dockerfiles

In order to build your own Docker image, for whatever project you are working on, you will need to build your own Dockerfile. Or build off someone else's. I'm told this can be quite the rabbit hole to go down. Let's try it and find out.

## Docker Hub

There are plenty of people out there already building their own Dockerfiles for the projects they work on. I've always been told that the easiest option to start with is to just grab someone's pre-built Dockerfile from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and move on with your life. Let's try it.
