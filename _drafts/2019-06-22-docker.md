It seems like Docker was an answer to the pains that came with virtual machines. Docker images are lighter weight in every way. It makes them better suited for bottling up your software for deployment. It means smaller images, and start up times in seconds instead of minutes. Maybe your image is a little less sandboxed than a full virtual machine, sure. But it's good enough.

Unlike a full virtual machine, a Docker image must have the same OS kernel as its host operating system. But that's it. It comes with the rest of the operating system it needs, along with the libraries and dependences for whatever app or tool is on the image. But because it shares the host system kernel, it is much smaller and takes longer to build than it otherwise would.

I figure the best way to learn Docker is to play around with it. So let's do that.


## Docker Hub

There are a *ton* of people out there using Docker for all kinds of projects. And some of these people share the work they do building a Docker image, so you can just grab there's and go. For instance, maybe you want to use MongoDB, chances are the Mongo team will have a publically available MongoDB image that you can just download and *poof*, you have a MongoDB up and rolling.

There are a couple of options here. First, you can go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and look around for an image. Or, if you're more of a commandline person, you can use the terminal:

```shell
$ docker search mongodb
NAME               DESCRIPTION                                     STARS    OFFICIAL    AUTOMATED
mongo              MongoDB document databases provide high avai…   5958     [OK]                
tutum/mongodb      MongoDB Docker image – listens in port 27017…   226                  [OK]
bitnami/mongodb    Bitnami MongoDB Docker Image                    85                   [OK]
...
```

Or, let's say you're interested in machine learning, maybe you want to play around with Tensorflow, but you want to skip all the installation steps and jump straight to trying out the new tool:

```shell
$ docker search tensorflow
NAME                           DESCRIPTION                           STARS  OFFICIAL  AUTOMATED
tensorflow/tensorflow          Official Docker images for the mac…   1431                                    
jupyter/tensorflow-notebook    Jupyter Notebook Scientific Python…   145                                     
...
```

There is one thing the commandline doesn't give you here, and it's versions. For instance, if you want the latest version of Mongo, you just do:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo
```

But if you building a production system, you probably don't want to just grab the "latest and greatest" version of MongoDB. You probably want to grab a *specific* version you have tested against. As far as I can tell, the Docker CLI `search` command does not allow you to see all the version tags of an image. But if you go through the website ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)), you will see all the tags available, so you can pull exactly what you want:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo:4.1-bionic
```


## Commandline

Docker comes with a powerful commandline tool. Obviously, if you type `docker` on the commandline you get a big list of commandline keywords. So once you know how to use Docker, that will be super helpful to you. It is probably not super helpful for beginners though.

Let's not try to cover every last feature of the CLI. Let's just cover the basics that you will need to know to start using Docker.

### docker search

We've already seen the `docker search` command. It lets you look for images other people have made. So, if all you need is an empty database or a fresh operating system. Boom. You can find that image in no time.

Again, I find the web interface more helpful than the CLI, because it lets me see detailed information on the versions/tags of each image available.

I like that Docker Hub shows the images that are "official" and created by the original project team. That's super handy. If security is a major concern, you probably shouldn't go with any image that isn't "official".

### docker pull

If you found an image on Docker Hub that you want, you just need to "pull" it:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo
```

If you want to pull a particular version of that image (which I would recommend), you can specify it with a colon:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo:4.1-bionic
```

### docker images

Okay, at any point you may want to check and see what images you have downloaded onto your system. Maybe just to check if your last pull is done, or maybe to remind yourself of what you did last week.

```shell
$ docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG           IMAGE ID        CREATED         SIZE
hellokube     v1            e65265fb1572    24 hours ago    109MB
nginx         latest        719cd2e3ed04    5 days ago      109MB
mongo         4.1-bionic    70ce1153b5d7    2 weeks ago     365MB
```

Here you can see I have three images downloaded onto my laptop.

#### Images vs Containers

In Docker speak, you can see that I have one "image" of MongoDB above. That is, I have one copy of everything I need to run a fresh, empty MongoDB on my local system. But I might want three Mongo databases running on my system (on three different ports), because I am currently working on three different projects. I could `docker run` this image three times and mount three different databases on three different ports. In Docker speak, I would have three "containers" of the same "image".

### docker run

Okay, so you have an image of MongoDB, but that doesn't mean the database is running on your system. For that you will need to "run" it, using the "IMAGE ID" you got from doing `docker images` above:

```shell
$docker run 70ce1153b5d7
```

Another option that I think is really useful here is to run the image in interactive mode. For instance, maybe I have a Debian Linux image that I use to test if something I am doing is compatible across Linux distros. Maybe all I want to do is pop into a Debian machine and run some BASH code. I could open the image into an interactive terminal mode using `-i` and `-d`:

```shell
$ docker run -i -t debian ./bin/bash
```

### docker ps

Okay, let's say we did the run command above on our MongoDB image. Then we ran a lot of code and you think your MongoDB might have crashed. So you want to check what Docker containers are running on your machine:

```shell
$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS
e752efa4fa62   70ce1153b5d7   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   13 minutes ago   Up 13 minutes   27017/tcp
```

## Dockerfiles

If Docker Hub doesn't have what you want, or you want to build a very specific environment for your own deployment, you will need to create your own Docker image from scratch. To do that, you're going to have to build your own Dockerfile. I'm told this can be quite the rabbit hole to go down. Let's try it and find out.
