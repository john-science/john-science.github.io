It seems like Docker was an answer to the pains that came with virtual machines. Docker images are lighter weight in every way. It makes them better suited for bottling up your software for deployment. It means smaller images, and start up times in seconds instead of minutes. Maybe your image is a little less sandboxed than a full virtual machine, sure. But it's good enough.

Unlike a full virtual machine, a Docker image must have the same OS kernel as its host operating system. But that's it. It comes with the rest of the operating system it needs, along with the libraries and dependences for whatever app or tool is on the image. But because it shares the host system kernel, it is much smaller and takes longer to build than it otherwise would.

I figure the best way to learn Docker is to play around with it. So let's do that.


## Docker Hub

There are a *ton* of people out there using Docker for all kinds of projects. And some of these people share the work they do building a Docker image, so you can just grab there's and go. For instance, maybe you want to use MongoDB, chances are the Mongo team will have a publically available MongoDB image that you can just download and *poof*, you have a MongoDB up and rolling.

There are a couple of options here. First, you can go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and look around for an image. Or, if you're more of a commandline person, you can use the terminal:

```shell
$ docker search mongodb
NAME               DESCRIPTION                                     STARS    OFFICIAL    AUTOMATED
mongo              MongoDB document databases provide high avai…   5958     [OK]                
tutum/mongodb      MongoDB Docker image – listens in port 27017…   226                  [OK]
bitnami/mongodb    Bitnami MongoDB Docker Image                    85                   [OK]
...
```

Or, let's say you're interested in machine learning, maybe you want to play around with Tensorflow, but you want to skip all the installation steps and jump straight to trying out the new tool:

```shell
$ docker search tensorflow
NAME                           DESCRIPTION                           STARS  OFFICIAL  AUTOMATED
tensorflow/tensorflow          Official Docker images for the mac…   1431                                    
jupyter/tensorflow-notebook    Jupyter Notebook Scientific Python…   145                                     
...
```

There is one thing the commandline doesn't give you here, and it's versions. For instance, if you want the latest version of Mongo, you just do:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo
```

But if you building a production system, you probably don't want to just grab the "latest and greatest" version of MongoDB. You probably want to grab a *specific* version you have tested against. As far as I can tell, the Docker CLI `search` command does not allow you to see all the version tags of an image. But if you go through the website ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)), you will see all the tags available, so you can pull exactly what you want:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo:4.1-bionic
```


## Commandline

Docker comes with a powerful commandline tool. Obviously, if you type `docker` on the commandline you get a big list of commandline keywords. So once you know how to use Docker, that will be super helpful to you. It is probably not super helpful for beginners though.

Let's not try to cover every last feature of the CLI. Let's just cover the basics that you will need to know to start using Docker.

## Dockerfiles

In order to build your own Docker image, for whatever project you are working on, you will need to build your own Dockerfile. Or build off someone else's. I'm told this can be quite the rabbit hole to go down. Let's try it and find out.
