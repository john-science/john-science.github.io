It seems like Docker was an answer to the pains that came with virtual machines. Docker images are lighter weight in every way. Which makes them faster and easier to use. They start up in seconds instead of in minutes. They can be entirely defined by a text file short enough you could Tweet it. Maybe your image is a little less sandboxed than a full virtual machine, sure. But it's good enough for a lot of applications.

Unlike a full virtual machine, a Docker image must have the same OS kernel as its host operating system. But that's it. It comes with the rest of the operating system, along with the libraries and dependences for whatever app or tool is on the image. But because it shares the host system kernel, it is much smaller and takes less time to build than it otherwise would.

I figure the best way to learn Docker is to play around with it. So let's do that.


## Docker Hub

There are a *ton* of people out there using Docker for all kinds of projects. And some of these people share the work they do building a Docker image, so you can just grab there's and go. For instance, maybe you want to use MongoDB, chances are the Mongo team will have a publically available MongoDB image that you can just download and *poof*, you have a MongoDB up and rolling.

There are a couple of options here. First, you can go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and look around for an image. Or, if you're more of a commandline person, you can use the terminal:

```shell
$ docker search mongodb
NAME               DESCRIPTION                                     STARS   OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED
mongo              MongoDB document databases provide high avai…   5958    [OK]
tutum/mongodb      MongoDB Docker image – listens in port 27017…   226                [OK]
bitnami/mongodb    Bitnami MongoDB Docker Image                    85                 [OK]
...
```

Or, let's say you're interested in machine learning, maybe you want to play around with Tensorflow, but you want to skip all the installation steps and jump straight to trying out the new tool:

```shell
$ docker search tensorflow
NAME                           DESCRIPTION                           STARS  OFFICIAL  AUTOMATED
tensorflow/tensorflow          Official Docker images for the mac…   1431
jupyter/tensorflow-notebook    Jupyter Notebook Scientific Python…   145
...
```

There is one thing the commandline doesn't give you here, and it's versions. For instance, if you want the latest version of Mongo, you just do:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo
```

But if you building a production system, you probably don't want to just grab the "latest and greatest" version of MongoDB. You probably want to grab a *specific* version you have tested against. As far as I can tell, the Docker CLI `search` command does not allow you to see all the version tags of an image. But if you go through the website ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)), you will see all the tags available, so you can pull exactly what you want:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo:4.1-bionic
```


## Commandline

Docker comes with a powerful commandline tool. Obviously, if you type `docker` on the commandline you get a big list of commandline keywords. So once you know how to use Docker, that will be super helpful to you. It is probably not super helpful for beginners though.

Let's not try to cover every last feature of the CLI. Let's just cover the basics that you will need to know to start using Docker.

### docker search

We've already seen the `docker search` command. It lets you look for images other people have made. So, if all you need is an empty database or a fresh operating system. Boom. You can find that image in no time.

Again, I find the web interface more helpful than the CLI, because it lets me see detailed information on the versions/tags of each image available.

I like that Docker Hub shows the images that are "official" and created by the original project team. That's super handy. If security is a major concern, you probably shouldn't go with any image that isn't "official".

### docker pull

If you found an image on Docker Hub that you want, you just need to "pull" it:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo
```

If you want to pull a particular version of that image (which I would recommend), you can specify it with a colon:

```shell
$ docker pull mongo:4.1-bionic
```

### docker images

Okay, at any point you may want to check and see what images you have downloaded onto your system. Maybe just to check if your last pull is done, or maybe to remind yourself of what you did last week.

```shell
$ docker images
REPOSITORY    TAG           IMAGE ID        CREATED         SIZE
hellokube     v1            e65265fb1572    24 hours ago    109MB
nginx         latest        719cd2e3ed04    5 days ago      109MB
mongo         4.1-bionic    70ce1153b5d7    2 weeks ago     365MB
```

Here you can see I have three images downloaded onto my laptop.

#### Images vs Containers

In Docker speak, you can see that I have one "image" of MongoDB above. That is, I have one copy of everything I need to run a fresh, empty MongoDB on my local system. But I might want three Mongo databases running on my system (on three different ports), because I am currently working on three different projects. I could `docker run` this image three times and mount three different databases on three different ports. In Docker speak, I would have three "containers" of the same "image".

### docker run

Okay, so you have an image of MongoDB, but that doesn't mean the database is running on your system. For that you will need to "run" it, using the "IMAGE ID" you got from doing `docker images` above:

```shell
$ docker run 70ce1153b5d7
```

Another option that I think is really useful here is to run the image in interactive mode. For instance, maybe I have a Debian Linux image that I use to test if something I am doing is compatible across Linux distros. Maybe all I want to do is pop into a Debian machine and run some BASH code. I could open the image into an interactive terminal mode using `-i` and `-d`:

```shell
$ docker run -i -t debian ./bin/bash
```

### docker ps

Okay, let's say we did the run command above on our MongoDB image. Then we ran a lot of code and you think your MongoDB might have crashed. So you want to check what Docker containers are running on your machine:

```shell
$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS
e752efa4fa62   70ce1153b5d7   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   13 minutes ago   Up 13 minutes   27017/tcp
```

### docker stop

Okay, very soon after you get your first Docker imaging running in a container, you will want to know how to stop it. Easy. You just need to grab the "CONTAINER ID" from above:

```shell
$ docker stop e752efa4fa62
```

#### docker ps -a

But this leads to a more complicated setup in your environment; you can have numerous containers where each one might be running or not. If you did a `docker ps`, it won't show stopped containers. To show those, you need to use the `-i` flag:

```shell
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND   CREATED  STATUS   PORTS   NAMES
$ 
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND              CREATED            STATUS   PORTS  NAMES
e752efa4fa62   70ce1153b5d7   "docker-entrypoi…"   About an hour ago  Exited          modest_kirch

```

### docker start

Whoops, you didn't mean to stop that Docker container. You want to start it back up again:

```shell
$ docker start e752efa4fa62
e752efa4fa62
$
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE         COMMAND          CREATED            STATUS         PORTS       NAMES
e752efa4fa62  70ce1153b5d7  "docker-entry…"  About an hour ago  Up 9 seconds   27017/tcp   modest_kirch
```

### docker rm

Okay, let's say we're done with a container and we want to totally delete it. First, we'll stop the container again:

```shell
$ docker stop e752efa4fa62
```

Now we can remove the container:

```shell
$ docker rm e752efa4fa62
e752efa4fa62
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE   COMMAND   CREATED  STATUS   PORTS   NAMES
```

Success!

### docker rmi

Okay, we removed the container we had running our MongoDB image, but we still have the image around. It's not hurting anything, but maybe we've decided we don't need it any more:

```shell
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hellokube           v1                  e65265fb1572        26 hours ago        109MB
nginx               latest              719cd2e3ed04        5 days ago          109MB
mongo               4.1-bionic          70ce1153b5d7        2 weeks ago         365MB
$ 
$ docker rmi mongo:4.1-bionic
$
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hellokube           v1                  e65265fb1572        26 hours ago        109MB
nginx               latest              719cd2e3ed04        5 days ago          109MB
```

Well, those are the basics. The Docker commandline has more options, but those are the basic commands you need to do basic things. It's a start, anyway.

## Dockerfiles

If Docker Hub doesn't have what you want, or you want to build a very specific environment for your own deployment, you will need to create your own Docker image from scratch. To do that, you're going to have to build your own Dockerfile. I'm told this can be quite the rabbit hole to go down... Let's find out!
