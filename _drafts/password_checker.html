<h4>This tool is...</h4>
<h4>Safe.</h4>
<p style="color:#999">You should think before typing your password into a strange page online. But this page is designed to protect you. This is a static webpage: no information you enter will be transmitted over the internet. The test is done 100% on YOUR computer. The information   is yours, and it is only safe with you.</p>
<h4>Basic.</h4>
<p style="color:#999">This tool tests for all the usual problems with weak passwords. But the only "real" way to test if a password is easy to crack is to try and crack it. The procedure here would be to encrypt your password with a really simple algorithm (like MD5), download   a modern password cracking program (like John the Ripper), and try and crack your password. That is a practical, real world test. However, I will not be providing that service free to the world.</p>
