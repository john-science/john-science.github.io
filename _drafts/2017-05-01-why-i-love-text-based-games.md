I love text-based games. They can be so much more unique and interesting than the average computer game. Modern, big budget games take huge teams to create: the 3D art department, the music team, acounting, HR, you name it. All that stuff gets between the creator and the idea.

And, if I am being totally honest, I covet the idea that one day I could write a decent text-based game. No corporate backing; just me and a laptop. It is <small>(theoretically)</small> possible that I could create some little game that a few people would love. You know, maybe. One day. A boy can dream.

Below are some of my favorite text-based games. All of these games have legions of fans. They all did something new, or creative, or fun, and people love them.

**And all these games are free to play, right now!**
