I love text-based computer games. They can be so much more unique and interesting than the average computer/video game. Modern, big budget games take huge teams to create: the 3D art department, the music team, acounting, HR, you name it. All that stuff gets between the creator and the idea.

If the selection of games in that graph seems random to you, that is no mistake. It turns out that modern video game companies are notoriously tight-lipped about how much money they spend making a game. And it is even harder to track down how many people worked on a game. What you see is what I could find and verify. But the trend is what is important. Little indie game makers (think Braid or Dwarf Fortress) can hang out in the middle of the chart. But most modern games need giant teams and multi-million dollar budgets. None of that is evil, but I have a hard time imagining one single person's creative vision surviving such a process.

Obviously, I am not saying that I do not appreciate big-budget 3D games. I wasted a lot of time playing Skyrim. But the games I have loved the most and become the most attached to have come from a very small team; one or a dozen people, working together on an idea they loved. I imagine there are games out there for my phone that are great for the same reason: they were built by a single developer with a dream. But I have not found too many of those so far.

And, if I am being totally honest, I covet the idea that one day I could write a decent text-based game. No corporate backing; just me and a laptop. It is <small>(theoretically)</small> possible that I could create some little game that a few people would love. You know, maybe. One day. A boy can dream.

Below are some of my favorite text-based games. All of these games have legions of fans. They all did something new, or creative, or fun, and people love them.

**And all these games are free to play, right now!**
