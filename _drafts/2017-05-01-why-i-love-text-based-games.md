I love text-based games. I frequently find they are a lot more unique and interesting than your typical computer/video game. My theory is that modern games have too many people between the creator(s) and the ideas: the 3D art department, the music team, advertising, acounting, HR, etcetera.

The selection of games in the chart above is arbitrary. These are simply the only games I could find good data on. But a trend is visible. Indie game makers (think Braid or Dwarf Fortress) can hang out in the middle of the chart. But most modern games need giant teams and multi-million dollar budgets. Which is fine, but how can a creative vision survive such a process?

I am not saying I do not appreciate big-budget 3D games. But the games I have loved the most and have become the most attached to have come from a very small team; one or a dozen people.

And, if I am being totally honest, I covet the idea that one day I could write a decent text-based game. No corporate backing; just me and a laptop. It is <small>(theoretically)</small> possible that I could create some little game that a few people would love. You know, maybe. One day. A boy can dream.

Below are some of my favorite text-based games. All of these games have legions of fans. They all did something new, or creative, or fun, and people love them.

**And all these games are free to play, right now!**
