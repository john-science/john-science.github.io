I love text-based games. They can be so much more unique and interesting than the average computer game. Modern, big budget games take huge teams: the 3D art department, the music team, acounting, HR, you name it. All that stuff gets between the creator and the idea.

All of these games have legions of fans. They all did something new, or creative, or fun, and people love them.

And all these games are free to play, right now!
