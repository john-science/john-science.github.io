[Chris Chibnall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chibnall) is about to take over as show runner for Doctor Who.  Fans are wondering what this will mean for the show.  What kinds of changes he will make?  One source of clues is that Chibnall has already written four full Doctor Who stories (including a two-parter), and several webisodes. Because I just cannot wait two years so find out, I thought I would re-watch all of Chibnall's past Doctor Who work to see what kind of a writer he is likely to be.


## Re-Watching Chibnall's Work

### Full-Episodes

* [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2007) - One of the most suspensful episodes of the 10th Doctor's tenure. What we learn about Chibnall here is that he is comfortable with sci-fi themes and does not mind killing characters...
* [The Hungry Earth / Cold Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hungry_Earth) (2010) - This story brings back a classic Doctor Who monster (enemy, anyway), but with a very fresh take...
* [Dinosaurs on a Spaceship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs_on_a_Spaceship) (2012) - A lot of people seem to dislike this episode, so keep that in mind. I actually thought it was a fun stand-alone episode when it first aired and quite liked it. On re-watching it I...
* [The Power of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Three_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - I remember liking it at the time, but what do I think now?

### Webisodes

* [Pond Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond_Life_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - Beautiful little day-in-the-life-of snippets for what it is like to be Amy and Rory when the Doctor is constantly jumping into and out of your life.
* [P.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.S._%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - Not sure I've ever seen this...

### Non-Who Work.

Chibnall has already worked with the next Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) on the crime drama [Broadchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadchurch). The show is a tense mystery with probably more adult themes and realistic reactions to violence than we've had on Doctor Who in the past. But the characters and stories were well-crafted, with season-long story arcs.

Chibnall also wrote several episodes of the Doctor Who spin-off [Torchwood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485301/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1). Torchwood was notably darker than Doctor Who.


## Post Mortem

> What did we learn?

Well, Chibnall doesn't mind killing off characters in each episode, so be prepared for that. And he has a good eye for long story arcs and connecting disparate parts of the canon together.  Which is good, since he is likely to be the showrunner for five years.
