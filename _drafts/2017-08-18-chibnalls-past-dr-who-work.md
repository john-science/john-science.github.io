{% include JB/setup %}

[Chris Chibnall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chibnall) is about to take over as show runner for Doctor Who, with a five-year contract.  What will this mean for the show?  Well, it turns out Chibnall has already written for the show. So I re-watched all of Chibnall's past work on Doctor Who to see what his work has been like.


## Re-Watching Chibnall's Work

Chibnall wrote 4 Doctor Who Stories and several webisodes.

### Full-Episodes

* [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2007) - One of the most suspensful episodes of the 10th Doctor's tenure.  There are some seriously out-there sci-fi ideas in this episode, and I like them.  Also, we see that Chibnall is okay with killing characters off and getting a little dark.
* [The Hungry Earth / Cold Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hungry_Earth) (2010) - This story brings back a classic Doctor Who monster / enemy, but with a somewhat more nuanced take.  The dark side of humanity takes center stage and is more central to the story than the lizard people and their laser guns.
* [Dinosaurs on a Spaceship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs_on_a_Spaceship) (2012) - People seem to either love or hate this episode.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  It has the best kind of Doctor Who campy humor.  Loved it.  Though pacing might have been a bit fast for my tastes.
* [The Power of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Three_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - The slow invasion of planet Earth is a great idea for an episode.  And I really liked the day-i\n-the-life-of vibe it had going on.  The ending was very positive: the Doctor saved everyone with the magic of plot holes.  But for all the silliness with the ending, the episode itself was a lot of fun.


### Webisodes

* [Pond Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond_Life_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - Beautiful little day-in-the-life-of vignettes, from the perspective of Amy and Rory when the Doctor is constantly jumping into and out of their lives. The scale of these stories is small; the Earth is not in danger. But they are quiet and beautiful and funny. I really like them.
* [P.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.S._%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - The after-effects of an adventure, told from the family perspecective.


### Non-Who Work.

Chibnall has already worked with the next Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) on the crime drama [Broadchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadchurch). The show is a tense mystery with more adult themes and realistic reactions to violence than we've had on Doctor Who in the past. But the characters and stories were well-crafted, with season-long story arcs. Maybe you could accuse the show of being a tad melodramatic, but you can't argue with the quality of the writing or the acting.

Chibnall also wrote several episodes of the Doctor Who spin-off [Torchwood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485301/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1). Torchwood was notably darker than Doctor Who.


## Post Mortem

> What did we learn?

Chinball seems to be comforrable being funny or getting dark.  He has world-saving narratives and smaller-scale personal stories.  He has done "serious drama" in Broadchurch, and cornball humor in "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship".  He seems to understand the Doctor's roll as the hero of the story, but also pays attention to the 'first do no harm' mentality that has been so central to the character (on and off) over the years. He is fine killing off non-central characters to build the suspense.

All told, Chibnall actually has a pretty well-rounded Doctor Who resume already.  That is an encouraging sign.  So far, he seems well-suited to take over as show runner.

The show needs fresh blood and fresh ideas, but it has found someone who has already proved his merit.  I now wonder if he was given so many opportunities in the past because someone at the BBC was testing him out for this position.

I am really excited to see what happens.
