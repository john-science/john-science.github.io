[Chris Chibnall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chibnall) is about to take over as show runner for Doctor Who for five years.  Fans are wondering what that will mean for the show.  One source of clues we have is that Chibnall has already written for Doctor Who.  So I thought I would rewatch all of Chibnall's past work as a writer for Doctor Who to see.


## Re-Watching Chibnall's Work

Chibnall wrote 4 Doctor Who Stories and several webisodes.

### Full-Episodes

* [42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2007) - One of the most suspensful episodes of the 10th Doctor's tenure.  There are some seriously sci-fi ideas in this episode, and they are well used.  Also, we see that Chibnall is okay with killing characters off and getting a little dark.
* [The Hungry Earth / Cold Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hungry_Earth) (2010) - This story brings back a classic Doctor Who monster / enemy, but with a somewhat more nuanced take.  The dark side of humanity takes center stage.  And is more important to the story than the lizard people and their laser guns.
* [Dinosaurs on a Spaceship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs_on_a_Spaceship) (2012) - A lot of people seem to dislike this episode, so keep that in mind.  I actually thought it was a lot of fun.  It was campy humor of the very best Doctor Who variety.
* [The Power of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_Three_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - The slow invasion of planet Earth is a great idea for an episode. And I really liked the day-in-the-life-of vibe it had going on. The ending was very positive: the Doctor saved everyone with the magic of plot holes. But for all the silliness with the ending, the episode itself was a lot of fun.


### Webisodes

* [Pond Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond_Life_%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - Beautiful little day-in-the-life-of snippets for what it is like to be Amy and Rory when the Doctor is constantly jumping into and out of your life.
* [P.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P.S._%28Doctor_Who%29) (2012) - Not sure I've ever seen this...

### Non-Who Work.

Chibnall has already worked with the next Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) on the crime drama [Broadchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadchurch). The show is a tense mystery with probably more adult themes and realistic reactions to violence than we've had on Doctor Who in the past. But the characters and stories were well-crafted, with season-long story arcs.

Chibnall also wrote several episodes of the Doctor Who spin-off [Torchwood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485301/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1). Torchwood was notably darker than Doctor Who.


## Post Mortem

> What did we learn?

Well, Chibnall doesn't mind killing off characters in each episode, so be prepared for that. And he has a good eye for long story arcs and connecting disparate parts of the canon together.  Which is good, since he is likely to be the showrunner for five years.
