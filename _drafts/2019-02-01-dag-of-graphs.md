I was introduced to graph theory first in a math class, and they were pristine, beautiful things, simple and elegant. Then I encountered graphs in computer science and the beauty quickly became easy to forget as I had to memorize the names of an ever increasing number of important graph types. I don't like to waste time memorizing details so I quickly found a way around this. I organized my thoughts on all the different types of graphs by building a Graph of Graphs (actually a DAG of Graphs). It was such an effective way to organize my thoughts I thought I would share it.
