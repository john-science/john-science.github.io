## What IS Technical Debt

Wikipedia:

> "Technical Debt is the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Analogous with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate "interest", making it harder to implement changes."

This is an analogy between ideas in software to those in finance. If we write bad code, that requires us to visit it later then that's a debt. We will have to pay these debt later, or it will grow over time until we are bankrupt. In software, "bankruptcy" is software that is so difficult to change that change grinds to a hault. Or slows down so that people spend more time fixing things than building new features. This is a real problem, and is extremely common.

> In this sense, "bad code" is code that requires us to revisit it later, because of its low quality or inapplicability to the solution.

The analogy to financial debt is good. Obviously, too much debt is ruinous. But some debt is good. You might take out a loan to buy a house. And that home loan might be part part of a larger financial plan that leads, eventually, to financial independence.


## Where does the analogy with real debt break down?

> 1. If you take out a loan, there is someone who lends us the money. And it is in their interest to remind us when payment is due.

Unfortunately, it is easy for a software project to get in the situation where no one is tracking the Technical Debt. If no one is keeping a ledger of the Technical Debt, if large chunks of debt are temporarily forgotten, the interest can accrue unchecked.

It is _possible_ for us to be far less efficient than a bank at demanding the debts be paid. In fact, this is quite common. Certainly, we aren't going to send hard collection agencies to harass ourselves. Without progressively agressive demands for repayment, the interest can grow unchecked in software in a way it would hardly never in finance.

> 2. If you owe money, your repayments are usually easy to track.

You usually pay back a financial debt based on a timed schedule. But for technical debt, your repayments are driven by urgency and utility.

If I write bad code today, I might be ashamed of myself. But if that code is in a part of the codebase that hardly ever changes, then I might not run into any big problems with that shoddy code for a while. Whereas if that code is in a really fast-moving, highly active part of the code, I will immediately start incurring high interest on that debt.

In fact, if an otherwise great system has one really ugly corner of bad code, its possible that's fine. If no one EVER needs to touch that part of the code again. Then the debt is extremely minimal. As long as future generations working on the code can understand it and its well-tested, having one ugly piece of code might be the right decision. Of course, being able to _predict_ that situation is very hard.

## How should we deal with it?

### Straw Men Fighting

> Hopefully, everyone on your team is an adult. But usually when we talk about the Technical Debt, we talk about Two Straw Men Fighting.

(Why are they "men", you ask? Because they're fighting.)

<img src="/assets/images/software/two_straw_men_fighting.png" alt="Straw Men Fighting">

One straw man is a software developer, who knows that if we take short cuts today, he will be stuck with code that is harder to support tomorrow. He will spend long, thankless hours bug-hunting and trying to fit new features in a system that isn't flexible enough. People will think he's slow at his job, and it will fall on him to pay off the interest of the technical debt.

The other straw man is a manager on the software project, who has hard deadlines to meet today, and don't care about the nerd warefare of "doing it right". It just needs to get done, that's all that matters.

These two straw men fight back and forth forever, constantly at war. Each trying to get what they need. One worried about this week's deadlines, the other worried about the medium-term life of the project.

Of course, in reality, this is only a fight if neither of these people understand the cost-benefit analysis of technical debt. If everyone on the project understands the software, and the idea of technical debt, they can make good medium-term plans for the project work.
