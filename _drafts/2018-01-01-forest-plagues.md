There are perhaps 100,000 species of tree in the world<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree#Overview" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia Reference">[1]</a></sup>, with about 16,000 of those in the Amazon rainforest<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest#cite_note-eurekalert.org-2" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia Reference">[2]</a></sup>. A few years ago I read a wonderful book: <a href="http://a.co/6YqQoNG" target="_blank" title="Link to Book on Amazon">Trees & Woodland in the British Landscape</a>, by Oliver Rackman. I have never been terribly interested in history, but this was a book more about the history of forests than people. Suddenly I was interested in history. After all, trees make up 25 percent of all the species on Earth<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree#Overview" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia Reference">[3]</a></sup>, so there is bound to be something exciting.

It turns out forests are constantly at war.  One minute an entire continent is covered in Aspen and the next Oaks have taken over. Shifts in weather, an ice age here, a couple pine cones washing up on the right shore and suddenly the world looks totally different. It is all happening too slow for human eyes, to be sure. But an amazing amount is known about the last hundred thousand years or so of forests in England, and the picture painted is a lot more exciting than I thought it would be.

All of the interesting stuff abruptly ends when humans start to settle England, of course. There isn't any natural forest left in the entire country, nothing wild remains. Today they have little stands and human-manicured "woods" that cover less than a percent of the old forest land area.


### The Great California Dought

On the time scale of trees, America is moving much faster. America started with thousands times more acres of forest than England, but have been able to remove most of it on the East Coast in less than 200 years. It took people nearly 5,000 years to do that to England. Impressive.

But the story in America is not over yet. The battle just began, really, and if you lived in California for the last 5 years it was a bit like watching the dinosaurs go extinct. In the last five years, California has lost 7.7 million acres of forest<sup><a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/news/releases/new-aerial-survey-identifies-more-100-million-dead-trees-california" target="_blank" title="USFS - CA tree death count">[4]</a></sup>, which is almost a third of all the trees in the state.  100 million trees died due to Climate Change and poor forest management.

The USFS is not, you might be surprised to learn, a bunch of tree-hugging hippies. Their report is short and to the point: we have lost trees that we need for industry. And 7.7 million dead trees poses a huge fire risk, which has claimed many homes and will claim many more.


### Sudden Oak Death

### The Chestnut Blight

The American Chestnut is Extinct

4 billion American Chestnuts died. They are now extinct in the wild. Again, there was even a huge economic impact:

### The Loss of the Quaking Aspen

Quaking Aspen aren't just some noisy trees high up in the Colorado mountains. If you walk through a grove of Quaking Aspen, you are actually walking through a single, giant organism. Forget dinosaurs and whale, the Quaking Aspen is the biggest thing that has ever lived on this planet. Entire forests, with tens of thousands of trees are one, single, giant, living organism.

They are not separate things, like normal trees. They are connected by enormous root systems under ground, and the Aspen themselves are just little sprouts that the organism sends up.  This has made Aspen groves some of the most successful and longest-living organisms on Earth. If there is a fire or an avalance, the grove is safe. Sure, all the trees might burn down or get knocked over, but they are just a small part of the whole.

The sheer enormity of some of the Quaking Aspen groves is hard to really wrap your mind around. We have nothing to relate it to. Imagine a house cat as big as mount Everest or a deer the size Manhattan. There just isn't a good analogy.

Of course, I wouldn't be talking about them if they wasn't some awful plague among them. Except we don't even fully understand what is killing the Quaking Aspen. Hopefully we find out in time to do something about it.

### That's Not All

The above is, by no means, a full list of all the plagues in America's forests. And, of course, I only know about the forests in my own country. 

The history of the forests over a country reads like an epic battle. With huge tides and surprising changes. Until people come into the story, then all the forests tend to die off.

If there was some great plague destroying all of America's oil people would be more likely to care about the problem and come together to fix it. But a nation is only as rich as its resources and America is just sitting by while one of our greatest resources just disappears.
