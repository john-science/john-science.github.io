I'd love to plant a tree with my own, bare hands. But I live in an apartment in the city. So for now, that will have to remain a pipe dream.

Luckily, there are dedicated people all around the world planting trees. Reforesting regions that have been stripped bare since the industrial revolution.

What follows is my short list of charities that will spend your money on planting trees, not on overhead. They will plant native trees where they are needed  most, working with the locals, and they have a solid track record.

### How to Validate a Charity

> Try not to give to a charity that spends more than 25% of donations on overhead.

The first question you might have is "How do I know these charities are legit?"  And *that* is a good question. Don't take my word for it. Do your research. To aid you in your research, here are four solid resources to use to look up a charty:

* [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/)
* [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/)
* [GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org/) - has actual IRS forms for US charities
* [Wise Giving Alliance](https://www.give.org/)


## Donate Passively

> Plant trees by seraching online.

Do you Google things a lot? Every time you search the internet, you generate revenue for that search engine. Why not pipe all that revenue into planting trees, rather than just getting a billionare a bigger mega yacht? If you use the [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/) search engine, about 50% of the revenue you passively generate by searching online goes to planting trees around the world.

As a bonus, Ecosia cares a LOT more about your privacy than Google does.
