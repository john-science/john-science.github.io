summary: A quick reference for where rock climbing hardware is manufactured.

{% include JB/setup %}

I have often wondered where my rock climbing gear was made, especially the hardware: stoppers, cams, and carabiners. But there is no central repository for such information online, so I am starting one here.

If you have references or citations for more information that should be added, please share it in the comments below and I will add it to the table. Please note, however, there is no column in the table below for political opinions. This is not the place to say you would rather have gear made in country X instaed of country Y.

In the end, climbing hardware is all about safety, and the most important factor in determining if your gear is safe to use is the quality of the engineering standards in your country. On climbing gear sold in America, you will find [UIAA markings](http://theuiaa.org/safety-standards/) on your gear showing that your gear has been tested to meet modern engineering standards.

I should note that the table above is only concerned with metal safety gear: cams (aliens/friends), stoppers (nuts), and carabiners. The table does *not* cover rope or other soft goods: slings, webbing, cord, port-a-ledges, haul bags, harnesses, or shoes.
