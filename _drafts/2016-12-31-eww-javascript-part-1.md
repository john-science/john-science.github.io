{% include JB/setup %}

Recently, I was wandering through some park in San Francisco with a friend who works at YouTube. As he started talking about his work, I joked:
    
> I've never learned JavaScript, but I've written a lot of it.

Like a lot of people, particularly back-end people, I had nothing but disdain for JavaScript. So I never sat down and learned the language like I did C++. I just hacked together enough JavaScript to get the rare page working and moved on with my life.

As we walked on, I found out that JavaScript was no longer a static language. There was a decade of inactivity while Internet Explorer dominated the browser world, sure. But new versions of ECMAScript have been coming out since 2009. 
    
> Okay, okay. Thom. I get it. I will go back and learn JavaScript for real. Finally.

This is not the point where I go on an angry triade against JavaScript.  To my surprise, it was an enjoyable (albeit highly flawed) language to learn.  I started by picking up the only good book available: [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://a.co/goIDRYe) which is a small, high-level guide to a small, high-level language.


### Minor Annoyances

What follows will be the least technical part of the EWW JavaScript series. These are just the petty, little things that bother people, but not the serious structural flaws we will meet later in the series.

#### The Name

JavaScript is a terrible name.  Basically everyone who encounters the language the first time is forced to ask the question:

> Hey, wait, is JavaScript related to Java?

The answer, of course, is no.  But why create the confusion in the first place?  It turns out this was a ploy made by the handsomest guys in marketing at Netscape in 1995. And we're stuck with it.
