I am learning a new language and wanted a list of the words I, personally, use the most. Baring differences between languages, I figured this would be a good place to start learning. As a data source, I found all the text messages and emails I have written in the past year (about 20,000 lines of text).

## Top 100

The 100 most common words I use (apparently) are:

    have not being will just get would can yes doing know all about good there think really what time work more thing day lot mean people sure very see want could how going okay now year maybe say make job also right should guess cool way much need hard only first probably little week might love take weekend try any which too sound fun awesome use new sorry long off big last back then something who next today month look nice around great never find these actually better kind before anyway bit couple idea those most game data interview other

The above list is the result of analyzing my own informal writing, after doing some basic data clean-up:

* **Make everything lowercase**
* **Replace Contractions with Complete Words**
* **Remove Numbers and Web Addresses**
* **Remove (most) punctuation and syntax**
* **Remove words that only appear once**
* **Remove pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, and articles**
* **Remove proper nouns**

Having a complete dataset for your own language usage is really fascinating.  There is a lot to learn about yourself and your language.  I highly recommend trying this process yourself.


## Final Results

Here I take it for granted that certain things are obviously necessary to learn in any language:

* pronouns
* articles
* conjuctions
* prepositions
* numbers
* the alphabet
* proper nouns

Below is my core vocabulary by part-of-speech.
