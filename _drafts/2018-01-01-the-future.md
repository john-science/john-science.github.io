No one can say for certain what the future will hold. But humans are pretty clever (<a target="_blank" href="https://xkcd.com/285/" title="XKCD Wikipedia Comic">[citation needed]</a>) and we know a surprising about about the future of our little planet at the universe.

You live on the planet Earth, orbiting a "main sequence" star named the Sun, in a ... system named the Solar System, in a ... spiral galaxy known as the Milky Way Galaxy. None of these things will last forever.

(For some reason the universe you live in doesn't have a name.) 

* 100 million A.D. - the next super continent on Earth will be formed - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth#Continental_drift

* 1-2 billion A.D. - loss of oceans - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth#Loss_of_oceans

* 2-4 billion A.D. - the Solar System is pretty stable, except maybe Mars and Venus get a lot more eccentric, so they might get ejected, or the Earth might.

* 4 billion A.D. +/- ??? - our Galaxy collides with Andromeda, neither survives - http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2014/03/24/scientists-predict-our-galaxys-death/


* 5.4 billion A.D. +/- ??? - sun starts to break down - http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/sun/sundeath.shtml
* 7.5 billion A.D. +/- ??? death of the sun - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#Future
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#The_Sun_and_planetary_environments
    * nice chronology graphic for the Sun - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#Chronology

* 1 quadrillion A.D. +/- ??? - the last planets will probably be stripped from orbit around the Sun

* 1 Googol A.D. - heat death of the universe - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe
    * though there are other theories - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe
