summary: The birth of the scientific method.

Perhaps my favorite story in science is also what I think of as the birth of the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method). To be fair, of course, it probably isn't the first time a group of people applied the scientific method. It has even been [argued](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6896998-the-art-of-tracking) the hunter-trackers of the stone age applied hypothetico-deductive reasoning long before the written word was invented. In any case, I would find arguements about who was "first" to be tedious, and would rather pass.

This is a story about the lives of three people. Eccentric, reclusive geniuses. Working independently and, frequenly, at odds from each. But in the end, their lives and works came together to discover gravity.

Our story starts on December 29, 1566, and Tycho Brahe is 20 years old. And drunk. And holding a sword. And in a dual. This will be his first and last dual, against his cousin. His third cousin, Manderup Parsberg, is also 20 years old, born just 10 days after Tycho. And he is also drunk. They've decided to dual in the dark. If Tycho loses this dual and dies, history will probably never learn the name Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton's first seminal work will be a lot thinner. Probably, it'll push the Enlightenment back quite a while. So the stakes are high.

What are they fighting over? The love of a good woman? No. Power? Money? Honor? No. No. Nope. Remember, the two men are family, close family, and friends. They are students at the same school, the Univeristy of Rostock. They have lives of immense wealth and power and luxury ahead of them. And what are they willing to risk this all for? On what matter of honor or philosophy does the future of our world hang? They are going to dual, to the death, over which one of them is the better mathematician.

<div style="background-color: #e7f3fe;border-left:5px solid #ffeb3b;"><strong>Historical Side Note:</strong> Contrary to what you may have seen in fiction, in real life when two rich, young men dualed it was probably for a stupid reason.</div>

But this is the real world, not a story. You were promised eccentric geniuses, not heros. But this dual is happening, and the fate of our future is at stake.

Tycho loses the dual.

Obviously, Tycho doesn't die. But his nose gets cut off. Maybe he was a later bloomer and became a genius later in life. Because at this point, he is bleeding in the dark. And we are some hundreds [?] of years before modern hospitals or germ theory. So young Tycho loses the nose, and for the next 34 years of his life he has to walk around without it. Prone to infections, and probably hard to look at, Tycho has a brass nose made. On special occassions he breaks out a silver or a gold one.

* [Tycho Brahe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe) spent his life collecting data on the positions of the planets in the sky.


<h2 style="text-align: center;">Johannes Kepler</h2>

* [Johannes Kepler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler) found patterns in that data, in the [Laws of Planetary Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion).

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Isaac Newton</h2>

* [Issac Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton) found the underlying laws of nature from those patterns: Graviation.
