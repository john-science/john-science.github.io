## Outline

This may not be the _first_ instance of the human race using the scientific method. I'd like to think the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians all discovered the scientific method, but their discovers were just lost to history. In any case, I'm not interested in getting into a definitial argument about "what is the scientific method" so we can say who "wins" as its first practictioner. What follows is one of my favorite stories. It's about how the entire lives of three people added up to the discovery of how our universe works.

* Tycho Brahe spent his life collecting data on the positions of the planets in the sky.
* Johannes Kepler found patterns in that data, in the Laws of Planetary Motion.
* Issac Newton found the underlying laws of nature from those patterns: Graviation.
