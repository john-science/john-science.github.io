> Money is Fictional

On first glance, a single bill that says "millions" or "billions" on it is just novel. And how cool to have something like that. Of course, that means an entire nation had a really rough patch. An economy was in shambles, at least for a short time.

This is also an object lesson in just how fictional money really is.
