> If you don't understand the idea of technical debt, you don't understand the life cycle of software. And you will never be able to do the cost-benefit analysis necessary to design or manage a software project.

## What IS Technical Debt

Wikipedia:

> "Technical Debt is the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Analogous with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate "interest", making it harder to implement changes."

## Where does the analogy with real debt break down?

* We owe the debt to ourselves.
* There is no bank forcing us to pay the debt.


## How should we deal with it?

### Straw Men Fighting

> Hopefully, everyone on your team is an adult. But usually when we talk about the Technical Debt, we talk about Two Straw Men Fighting.

(Why are they "men", you ask? Because they're fighting.)

One straw man is a software developer, who knows that if we take short cuts today, he will be stuck with code that is harder to support tomorrow. He will spend long, thankless hours bug-hunting and trying to fit new features in a system that isn't flexible enough. People will think he's slow at his job, and it will fall on him to pay off the interest of the technical debt.

The other straw man is a manager on the software project, who has hard deadlines to meet today, and don't care about the nerd warefare of "doing it right". It just needs to get done, that's all that matters.

These two straw men fight back and forth forever, constantly at war. Each trying to get what they need. One worried about this week's deadlines, the other worried about the medium-term life of the project.

Of course, in reality, this is only a fight if neither of these people understand the cost-benefit analysis of technical debt. If everyone on the project understands the software, and the idea of technical debt, they can make good medium-term plans for the project work.
