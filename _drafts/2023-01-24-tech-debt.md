> If you don't understand the _idea_ of technical debt, you can't understand the life cycle of software. You will never be able to do the cost-benefit analysis necessary to work on the design/architecture of software. And you will NEVER be capabale of managing a software project.

## What IS Technical Debt

Wikipedia:

> "Technical Debt is the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Analogous with monetary debt,[3] if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate "interest", making it harder to implement changes."
