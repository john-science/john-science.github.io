I dug up thousands of Google chat messages from the last year to analyze my own word choice.

I am learning a new language and wanted a list of my personal, my commonly-used words. Baring differences between the language, I guess this word list is probably place to start learning in the new language.  The 100 most common words I use (apparently) are:

> not have just will can would know about good all there get think really time work did more what mean people sure had okay lot see now how want could maybe cool job right day make guess got hard much also love going very should awesome only has does been little probably way too might fun need any then weekend thought sorry next thing which today back try long last nice take big around off new never look climbing who something year better man use data week anyway couple idea always actually bit great those find before interview doing other

The above list is the result of analyzing about 20,000 lines of my own informal writing, after doing some basic data clean-up:

* **Make everything lowercase**
* **Remove (most) punctuation and syntax**
* **Remove Contractions** - That is, "can't" became "can" and "not".
* **Remove Numbers and Web Addresses**
* **Remove proper nouns**
* **Remove personal pronounds, conjunctions, prepositions, and articles**
* **Remove words that only appear once**

What I was looking for was a big list of the nouns and verbs I need to learn. But what I actually got was a treasure trove of information about myself and the language usage.  Things I learned:

* **Not Nouns and Verbs** - Most of the top 100 words are not nouns or verbs but: articles, conjuctions, prepositions, pronouns, and the to-be verb.
* **Me Me Me** - I never realized how much I must talk about myself.  The first word on my list is `I`, and `my` and `me` make the top 40. So that's a hard truth.
* **Vocab Size** - I also found that I have about an 80,000 word vocabulary (if you include proper nouns), but of that the first 1,000 words are far more common. (Apparently, these should be the words to focus on when learning a new language.)
