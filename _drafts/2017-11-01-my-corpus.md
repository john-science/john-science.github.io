I dug up thousands of lines of text messages and online chatting, thousands of emails, formal writting, and every scrap of English writing I have done in the last 12 years to analyze my language usage.

This all started because I am learning a new language and wanted to build a quick list of all the most important vocabulary I would need.  Because I know language include huge vocabularies, btu I also know that I personally use a small, unique subset for my daily usage.  It would be best to start learning those words, tailored to my life, right?
