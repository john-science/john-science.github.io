I dug up thousands of Google chat messages from the last year to analyze my own word choice.

I am learning a new language and wanted a list of my personal, my commonly-used words. Baring differences between the language, I guess this word list is probably place to start learning in the new language.  The 100 most common words I use (apparently) are:

> i the a to is it and that you not of in have but for are just be do will on like so my am we was they can yeah if this would at or me with know about good well oh all he there get your think really one though work time out she some more did as no what up mean sure people an okay lol see lot from still had now want could them maybe how cool right job day guess make got go than hard when much because ah also love pretty going awesome should only

The above list is the result of analyzing about 20,000 lines of my own informal writing, after doing some basic data clean-up:

* **Make everything lowercase**
* **Remove (most) punctuation and syntax**
* **Remove Contractions** - That is, "can't" became "can" and "not".
* **Remove Numbers and Web Addresses**

What I was looking for was a big list of the nouns and verbs I need to learn. But what I actually got was a treasure trove of information about myself and the language usage.  Things I learned:

* **Not Nouns and Verbs** - Most of the top 100 words are not nouns or verbs at all but: articles, conjuctions, pronouns, and the to-be verb.
* **Me Me Me** - I never realized how much I must talk about myself.  The first word on my list is `I`, and `my` and `me` make the top 40. So that's a hard truth.
* **Vocab Size** - I also found that I have about an 80,000 word vocabulary (if you include proper nouns), but of that the first 1,000 words are far more common. (Apparently, these should be the words to focus on when learning a new language.)

My TODO List:

> TODO: 1. Find most common nouns, verbs, and adjectives. 2. Fix yeah=yes, had=have, has=have, loved=love, loves=love, was=is, "to be"=is, "will be"=is, people=person, knew=know. 3. Write a script to pull out pronouns, to-bes, conjunctions, oh/ow/um/aww/lol/etc/ and articles.
