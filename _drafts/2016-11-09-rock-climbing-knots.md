summary: A minimal set of knots that I absolutely must know to go rock climbing.

{% include JB/setup %}

Most climbers only know 4-12 knots, and that's enough. Which is not to say that having more tools in your toolbox is not helpful. But all you need is to know one knot for each and every need you have. But you need to know that knot well enough to tie it safely while tired and distracted.

What follows is the minimal set of knots that I use. This is not meant to be a complete guide to all the climbing knots in the world. There are already plenty of [those](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climbing_knots) out [there](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexclimbing.php#ScrollPoint). I can not say what you will need when you climb, only what I need. This is just a guide to the basics.

### <a name="figure8"></a>Figure 8 Follow Through

This is the knot you will use to tie into your harness. And sometimes to tie into a trad anchor.

In the old days, people used to tie into their harness with a bowline. That has fallen out of favor now, due to safety concerns. <sub>[1](http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/rethinking-the-double-loop-bowline) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_on_a_bight#Dangers)</sub> It is important that you learn to tie this knot neatly and cleanly, so that your climbing partner can quickly and easily tell if you are safe and ready to climb.

#### Variants

* [Figure 8 on a Bight](https://youtu.be/D8jRok7Kofw?t=13) - useful for tying into a trad anchor

### <a name="overhand"></a>Overhand

This knot is so basic you probably grew up being able to tie it. And you just called it "a knot".

This knot has three major uses. First, a lot of people use it as a backup knot for their harness tie-in. This has the added adavantage of ensuring the free end of the rope can not hit you in the eye. Second, it is smart to tie this knot into the rope before a long repell, so you do not repel of the end of the rope. Lastly, belayers frequently tie this knot in their end of the rope, so the climber can not leave belay if they climb too far or take a big fall.

I would be extremely suspicious of any climber that can not tie an overhand knot blindfolded.

### <a name="doublefisherman"></a>Double Fisherman

The double fisherman is used to turn a length of cord into a loop. This basic knot lets people build anchors with cord (as opposed to slings).

### <a name="girth"></a>Girth Hitch

If we are lucky, we can use a tree as part of our anchor. A good tree can make a really solid anchor and much faster than usual. Just toss some webbing around the trunk, and finish off with a girth hitch. Done.

### <a name="prusik"></a>Prusik

You will need to know how to tie a Prusik if you ever want to repel from a climb. Repelling is the absolute most basic self-rescue technique for rock climbers. And repelling is often the only way down from a multi-pitch climb.

### <a name="munter"></a>Munter Hitch

If you drop your belay device, you can use the munter hitch to belay your partner. This is an extremely valuable skill to have in your toolbox. Since the munter hitch can be easily tied with one hand, I can not think of any reason to learn how to tie it with two.

</a>

#### Variants

* The [Super Munter](https://youtu.be/OLaEmPs7tac?t=7) - used for belaying, but has more friction in the system, so you can belay more weight and slower

### <a name="mule"></a>Munter Mule Hitch

The munter mule is a favorite knot to escape a belay. That is, if you are belaying and the climber is stopped for a long time or you need to do something, how do you let go of the rope? Tie a munter mule into the rope and then clip the loop into the anchor. Bam. Now your hands are free to do whatever.

### <a name="butterfly"></a>Alpine Butterfly Loop

The Alpine Butterfly loop is a great way to create a little loop in your rope. And the loop will not come undone if you pull on the rope in either direction. If your rope gets worn or you get a core break, you can use this knot to isolate the offending section of rope. It is easy to learn, and takes less rope than a figure-8-on-a-bight.

### <a name="clove"></a>Clove Hitch

When leading a trad climbing, you can use the clove hitch to quickly tie into an anchor. Or you can even use it to help equalize a trad anchor. The clove hitch can be easily tied with one hand. And if you are leading a climb, you might only have one hand free. Definitely learn the one-hand method.

### Bonus Knots

* [Monkey's Fist](https://youtu.be/gp9w-T2d_NY?t=7) - Great fun. If your friends look bored, toss them a Monkey's Fist. It does not get used often in climbing. But it is helpful if you ever need to throw a rope: up to a climber, or over a tree branch.
* [One-Handed Figure 8](https://youtu.be/-iE8WG33xJY?t=1) - Look like a cowboy when you tie in. It turns out, if your reflexes are good, you can tie a figure 8 with one hand. This is more for style points than anything else.
