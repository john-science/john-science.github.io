Standard safety warning:

> I do not know what kind of climbing you are doing, or what kind of trouble you might get yourself in. You, and you alone, are responsible for your own safety.

What follows is the minimal set of knots that I think I need to know to go rock climbing. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the climbing knots in the world, there are already plenty of [those](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climbing_knots) out [there](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexclimbing.php#ScrollPoint). I have not find such lists useful.

It is more important to know some set of knots extremely well than to know a great variety of knots. When climbing, you might find yourself having to tie a knot one-handed while extremely tired and distracted. In those situations it is more important to understand one knot extremely well, and to have it totally dialed in, than it is to know 20 different knots to choose from.

### Figure 8 Follow Through

> Uses: attaching the rope to your harness or other closed loops

This is the knot used to tie the rope into the harness.

In the old days, people used to tie into their harness with a bowline. That has fallen out of favor, due to safety concerns. <sub>[1](http://www.rockandice.com/lates-news/rethinking-the-double-loop-bowline) [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowline_on_a_bight#Dangers)</sub> It is important that you learn to tie this knot neatly and cleanly, so that your climbing partner can quickly and easily tell if you are safe and ready to climb.

### Overhand

> Uses: back-up knot, and stopper knot

This knot is so basic you probably grew up being able to tie it. And you just called it "a knot".

This knot has three major uses. First, a lot of people use it as a backup knot for their harness tie-in. This has the added adavantage of ensuring the free end of the rope does not hit you in the eye. Second, it is smart to tie this knot into the rope before a long rappel, so you do not rappel of the end of the rope. Lastly, belayers sometimes tie this knot in their end of the rope, so the climber can not climb (or fall) past the end of the rope.

### Double Fisherman

> Uses: joining two ends of rope, creating a loop of cord

Most generally, the double fisherman is used to connect two ends of cord or rope. Most commonly, people use the double fisherman to create a loop of cord for building and anchor.

### Girth Hitch

> Uses: attaching a loop to things, building anchors

When you get lucky, you can use a tree as part of your anchor. A good tree can make a really solid anchor fast. Just toss some webbing around the trunk, and finish off with a girth hitch. Done. On rare occassion, people also use this knot to connect a sling to their rope.

### Prusik

> Uses: friction knot to attach a cord to a rope, auto-blocking rappel and belay, ascending rope

You will need to know how to tie a Prusik if you ever want to rappel from a climb. Rappelling is the absolute most basic self-rescue technique for rock climbers, and often the only way down from a multi-pitch climb. One Prusik can serve as an auto-block while rappelling, two can help you ascend rope in a pinch.

### Munter Hitch

> Uses: belaying without a belay device

If you drop your belay device, you can use the munter hitch to belay your partner. This is an extremely valuable skill to have in your toolbox. Learn to tie it with one hand.

**Variants**

* The [Super Munter](https://youtu.be/OLaEmPs7tac?t=7) - used for belaying, but has more friction in the system, so you can belay more weight and slower

### Munter-Mule Overhand

> Uses: Escaping the belay, passing a knot on rappel, self-rescue

The munter-mule is a favorite knot to escape a belay. That is, if you are belaying and the climber is stopped for a long time or you need to do something, how do you let go of the rope without dropping your partner? Tie a munter mule into the rope and then clip the biner into the loop. Bam. Now your hands are free to do whatever.

The real benefit of the munter-mule is that it allows for a smooth transition back to belaying. Just undo the loop and you have your normal munter hitch.

As an added bonus, you can use the munter-mule to pass a knot on rappel. For instance, if your rope has a core break, you pretect that with a butterfly knot, but the knot won't have to stop you rappelling if you use the munter-mule.

### Alpine Butterfly Loop

> Uses: isolating bad sections of rope, attaching yourself to the anchor

The Alpine Butterfly loop is a great way to create a little loop in your rope. And the loop will not come undone if you pull on the rope in either direction. If your rope gets worn or you get a core break, you can use this knot to isolate the offending section of rope. It is easy to learn, and takes less rope than a figure-8-on-a-bight.

### Clove Hitch

> Uses: attaching yourself to the anchor, building anchors, attaching things to the center of the rope

When leading a trad climbing, you can use the clove hitch to quickly tie into an anchor. Or you can even use it to help equalize a trad anchor. Definitely learn to tie the clove hitch with one hand.

### Bonus Knots

* [Monkey's Fist](https://youtu.be/gp9w-T2d_NY?t=7) - Great fun. If your friends look bored, toss them a Monkey's Fist. It does not get used often in climbing. But it is helpful if you ever need to throw a rope: up to a climber, or over a tree branch.
* [One-Handed Figure 8](https://youtu.be/-iE8WG33xJY?t=1) - Look like a cowboy when you tie in. It turns out, if your reflexes are good, you can tie a figure 8 with one hand. This is more for style points than anything else.
