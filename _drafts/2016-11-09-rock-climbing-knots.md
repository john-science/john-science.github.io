summary: A minimal set of knots that I absolutely must know to go rock climbing.

{% include JB/setup %}

Most climbers only know 4-12 knots, and that's enough. You only need to know one knot for each situation you might find yourself in. But you have to know that knot well enough to tie it safely while tired and distracted.

What follows is the minimal set of knots that I feel I need to know to be safe doing the kinds of climbing that I personally do. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the climbing knots in the world. There are already plenty of [those](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climbing_knots) out [there](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexclimbing.php#ScrollPoint).

* **Pro Tip**: All three of the above hitches can be [tied with one hand](http://www.climbing.com/skills/learn-this-one-handed-munter-and-clove-hitches/). This is extremely helpful; learn this.
* **Pro Tip**: Every climber needs to know at least one [hitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hitch_knots) and at least one [bight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_%28knot%29).

### Figure 8 Follow Through

This is the knot you will use to tie into your harness. And sometimes to tie into a trad anchor.

### Overhand

This knot is so basic you probably grew up being able to tie it. And you just called it "a knot".

### Double Fisherman

The double fisherman is used to turn a length of cord into a loop. This is a really basic knot to know. This is the basic knot that lets people build anchors with cord (as opposed to slings).

### Girth Hitch

Some days we get lucky and we can use a tree as part of our anchor. A good tree can really make a solid anchor and much faster than usual. Just toss some webbing around the trunk, and finish off with a girth hitch. Done.

### Prussik

You will need to know how to tie a Prussel Prussik if you ever want to repel from a climb. And repelling is the absolute most basic self-rescue technique for rock climbers.

### Munter Hitch

If you drop your belay device on a climb, you can use the Munter Hitch to belay your partner safely. This is an extremely valuable skill to have in your toolbox, as shit happens.

### Munter Mule Hitch

The munter mule is the favorite knot to escape a belay. That is, if you are belaying and the climber is stopped for a long time and you need to do something, how do you let go of the rope? Tie a munter mule into the rope and then clip the loop into the anchor. Bam, now your hands are free to do whatever.

### Super Munter Hitch

Very similar to the regular munter hitch, the super munter hitch can be used in place of a belay device. The difference here is that the super munter hitch has a lot more friction in the system, so you can lower much heavier loads more safely. This knot is sufficient for even search-and-rescue teams to lower the injured.

### Alpine Butterfly Loop

The Alpine Butterfly loop is a great way to create a little loop in your rope. And if the rope is pulled from either direction, the knot won't come undone. You might want to use this knot to isolate a worn section of your rope, to tie off against a core break in your rope, or just to help equalize a trad anchor. It is easy to learn, and takes less rope than a figure-8-on-a-bight.
