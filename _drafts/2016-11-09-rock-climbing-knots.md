Most climbers only know 4-12 knots, and that's enough. You only need to know one knot for each situation you might find yourself in. But you have to know that knot well enough to tie it safely while tired and distracted.

What follows is the minimal set of knots that I feel I need to know to be safe doing the kinds of climbing that I personally do. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the climbing knots in the world. There are already plenty of [those](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_climbing_knots) out [there](http://www.animatedknots.com/indexclimbing.php#ScrollPoint).

* **Pro Tip**: All three of the above hitches can be [tied with one hand](http://www.climbing.com/skills/learn-this-one-handed-munter-and-clove-hitches/). This is extremely helpful; learn this.
* **Pro Tip**: Every climber needs to know at least one [hitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hitch_knots) and at least one [bight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bight_%28knot%29).

What knots do you use that I do not? Am I missing an important rescue knot? Leave a comment below.
