# Antineutrino

This is a blog-ish platform about minor obsessions. Every day I come across things that I find totally engrossing. For five minutes or five weeks I am totally absorbed and can't think of anything else. If, during the course of my minor obsessions, I generate any useful information or tools, I might share them here.

Topics of Interest:

* Software
* The Environment
* Physics
* Math
* Science Fiction
* and anything else
