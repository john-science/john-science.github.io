## The Immortal Game

**Anderssen vs. Kieseritzky, 1851  (1-0)** It seems like every player has their own "Immortal Game" now, but this was the first, the original. If for no other reason, this game is famous because Anderssen sacrifices nearly all his pieces to win this game.

## Evergreen Game

**Anderssen vs. Dufresne, 1852.  (1-0)** It was said that as long as chess was played this game would remain every green. In it, Anderssen certainly shows a lot of really good techniques for newer players to mimic: he controls the center of the board, he castles early and his opponent doesn't, and it shows how to attack an uncastled King.

## The Opera Game

**Morphy vs. Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard, 1858.  (1-0)** The story behind this game is great. The Count and Duke, two amateurs, invite Morphy to the opera and instead of let him watch, they face him away from the stage to play them in a game of chess. Looking over his shoulder the whole time, Mophy still shows great control over development, initiative, and the attack.
