The <a href="https://www.arborday.org/trees/whattree/whatTree.cfm">Arbor Day website</a> is a good resource for IDing trees in North America. (For now, I'm confining this work to just the trees of North America. It's where I live, and is a big enough topic for one mortal.)


<h2>High-Level Taxonomy</h2>

All trees are either [Gymnosperms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnosperm) / softwoods or [Angiosperms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant) / hardwoods.

Angiosperms are flowering plants. They are relatively newer than Gymnosperms, and are really catching on. Between 140 and 120 million years ago flowering plants started to spread and they haven't stopped since.  Apparently, Darwin thought this was quite the mystery.

<b>Gymnosperms</b> include: conifers, cycads, and ginko trees. All other trees are <b>Angiosperms</b>.

Angiosperms aren't just flowering, their seeds also have casings.


<h2>Identifying Conifers</h2>

[This](https://leafyplace.com/identifying-conifers-pine-fir-spruce/) guide to identifying conifers is just excellent. Worth a second read.
