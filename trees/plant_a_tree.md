### How to Validate a Charity

> Try not to give to a charity that spends more than 25% of donations on overhead.

Here are some good resources to research a charity before you give:

* [GuideStar](https://www.guidestar.org/) - has actual IRS forms for US charities
* [Wise Giving Alliance](https://www.give.org/)
* [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/)
* [Charity Watch](https://www.charitywatch.org/)
