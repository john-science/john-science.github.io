For help identifying trees, check out the <a href="https://www.arborday.org/trees/whattree/whatTree.cfm">Arbor Day website</a>.


<h2>High-Level Taxonomy</h2>

All trees are either [Gymnosperms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnosperm) / softwoods or [Angiosperms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant) / hardwoods.

Angiosperms are flowering plants. They are relatively newer than Gymnosperms, and are really catching on. Between 140 and 120 million years ago flowering plants started to spread and they haven't stopped since.  Apparently, Darwin thought this was quite the mystery.

<b>Gymnosperms</b> include: conifers, cycads, and ginko trees. All other trees are <b>Angiosperms</b>.

Angiosperms are also different because their seeds have cases.


<h2>Identifying Conifers</h2>

[This](https://leafyplace.com/identifying-conifers-pine-fir-spruce/) guide to identifying conifers is just excellent. Worth a second read.
