> I just love trees.

I am trying to learn to identify trees. But there's a lot to learn, so I'm putting my notes here.

* [The Taxonomy of Trees](tax.html) - all tree species, with Wiki links
* [Plant a Tree](plant_a_tree.html) - Do it yourself or donate.
* [Just my stupid notes](edu.html) while I learn about trees
