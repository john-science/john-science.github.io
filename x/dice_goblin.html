## Dherm'Gorphyek Diety Information

Dherm'Gorphyek is a God of Gambling and Dreams. The two often go together.

Actually, most of his worshipers aren't Goblins. And those who can't pronounce his name just call him "the Dice Goblin".

* Chaotic Neutral
* Lesser Deity
* Holy days: the Summer and Winter Solstices
* Holy symbol: None official, but unofficially two dice (one white, one green, on a silver field)
* No holy books or temples


### Joining Dherm'Gorhyek

To become an Initiate of Dherm'Gorphyek is easy; gods want followers and getting people hooked is the name of the game. DG might even come looking for you.

All you really have to do is fall asleep thinking about him, and he will visit you in your dreams. Though it will help if you gambled or did something stupidly risky that day. Or if you have spoken with one of his followers recently.

Joining is easy. But leaving the Dice Goblin would be a Hell of a risk.


### Initiate

Every follower starts out as an Initiate. 

Everything a follower learns about their faith they learn directly from Dherm'Gorphyek when he visits them in their dreams. Though he visits rarely: on holy days or to inform someone of a change to their status in the church. The more one advances in the faith, the more they speak with Dherm'Gorphyek, the more deep secrets they learn about their god and their church.

The first thing to know is that the Dice Goblin does not have holy books or temples or priests or rules. Dherm'Gorphyek does not care if you are good or evil. He does not have commandments. And he does not ask for holy wars against non-believers.

The Dice Goblin likes it when you gamble. With money or more metaphorically. He loves gladiators who risk it all in the arena. And adventurers who go off on ridiculous quests. For that reason, he also really likes people that run taverns that allow gambling, or gladitorial arenas, or brothels. Encouraging others to make risky decisions is just as good, to the Dice Goblin.

You will advance in the religion when the Dice Goblin himself decides you are living the correct life.

All Initiates are told, in their first dream with the Dice Goblin, to find an object to imbue as their Holy Symbol. As most people choose the Path of the Gambler, they pick a set of Dice or cards or a coin to toss. But Adventurers and others on the Path of the Bezerker often pick a small weapon, like a knife. Whatever you pick it must be small enough to keep on you at all times. If you lose your symbol or it is destroyed, you can re-consecrate a new one by falling asleep holding it and thinking about the Dice Goblin.


### Acolyte

The Dice Goblin is a lot more interactive than most gods. He grants boons and gives rewards. Particularly if people are watching. If you are about to roll the dice on a bet for your house, or charge into battle and certain death, shout the Dice Goblin's name for all to hear. He might just make sure you win in the showiest possible display of radiant magic. That's the sort of thing that gets a good more followers.

The most important thing an Acolyte learns is that the followers that reach the rank of Chosen are invited to live forever in the afterlife created by the Dice Goblin. It is the same Dreamworld in which they have already spoken to him. It is an endless inn, with endless private rooms, each one holding a massive feast. The food and drink never runs out. There are rooms for all cultures and styles and desires. There are even arenas, for the mightiest among them to hone their skills and battle for glory throughout all eternity. There are little back rooms to cater to all desires; libraries and small rooms containing entire worlds of wilderness to explore. And for those interested, orgies.


#### The Paths

You are now able to choose between three paths, and it is hard to switch between them once you have chosen:

* **Path of the Gambler** - For gifts of wealth. (most common)
* **Path of the Bezerker** - For gifts in battle.
* **Path of the Sourcerer** - For gifts of of magic. (least common)


### Disciple - WIP

The Dice Goblin isn't above earthly concerns. A discipline of Dherm'Gorphyek is likely to see the knife they are holding turn into gold at random. 

TODO

From this rank and higher, the Dice Goblin might randomly give you aid or gifts at any time. Gifts are more likely:

* the higher your status in the religion
* if you have their Holy Symbol on you
* on the Summer and Winter Solstice 
* if you invoke his name in front of non-believers

Most importantly, if a Disciple dies while taking some great risk, they will be raised to Chosen. And thus allowed to enter the great feast of the afterlife. As such, some Disciples take extravagent risks with their lives, especially those who battle or adventure already.


#### The Paths

If in possession of your Holy Symbol: 

* **Path of the Gambler** - +1 Persuasion when haggling over the value of an item
* **Path of the Bezerker** - +1 to Death Saving throws
* **Path of the Sourcerer** - Once per Long Rest, you can cast any level 1 spell you know for free (no spell slot), but you have a 100% chance to incur Wild Magic


### Chosen - WIP

This is the goal of everyone in the religion.. The Chosen will spend eternity in the dream world afterlife set up for them by the Dice Goblin. And he will be among them, feasting and gambling and gaming and fighting.

The Chosen learn that in his mortal life Dherm'Gorphyek was worried about death, and the lack of afterlife that would follow it. So he sought deification as a way around death for himself. But he also sought a way out of Death for everyone. And so he conceieved of a way to turn his artificial Dream World into an eternal resting place for the minds of others. But he would only take those who could prove they were sure they wanted it.

It is at this point, perhaps after a lifetime of worship and sacrifice, that a member of the faith might see a loving, caring side to their god.

The Chosen are truly not frightened of death. As such, they can be truly terrifying in battle. And the Acolytes and Disciples around them that know often look on them with envy and awe.


#### The Paths

If in possession of your Holy Symbol: 

* **Path of the Gambler** - +2 Persuasion when haggling over the value of an item
* **Path of the Bezerker** - +2 to Death Saving throws
* **Path of the Sourcerer** - Once per Long Rest, you can cast any level 1 or 2 spell you know for free (no spell slot), but you have a 100% chance to incur Wild Magic


### Zealot

Strictly speaking, there is no reason to bother ascending past Chosen. The Dice Goblin does not ask it of any of his followers. And since the religion has no priests, this is not even a ceremonial role. However, Dherm'Gorphyek sees that some of his followers are fanatical than others, so he makes a place for them. And, of course, with this greater status in the church comes more and greater material rewards from their God.

Also, true zealots of the church of the Dice God are told the full truth about their religion and their god.

Zealots are told that Dherm'Gorphyek was the name of a mortal Goblin once. That the Dice Goblin is more interested in earthly matters than most gods because he remembers being mortal (or at least tries to). He appears in the dreams of the new Zealot and shares with them the full story of his life as a mortal, leading to deification.

It is not like a god to share his faults, or be personal in any way. But perhaps Dherm'Gorphyek is expecting to spend eternity in an inn feasting and gambling with this person, and the barriers are no longer necessary.


#### The Paths

If in possession of your Holy Symbol:

All paths receive **Confidence of the Zealot**: +1 to all Saving Throws

* **Path of the Gambler** - +3 Persuasion when haggling over the value of an item
    * Can cast Distort Value for free (no spell slot), once per Long Rest
* **Path of the Bezerker** - +2 to Death Saving throws (stacks with Confidence of Zealotry)
    * Can cast Disquise Self for free (no spell slot), once per Long Rest
* **Path of the Sourcerer** - Once per Long Rest, you can cast any level 1 or 2 spell you know for free (no spell slot), but you have a 100% chance to incur Wild Magic
    * Can cast Comprehend Languages for free (no spell slot), once per Long Rest


#### The Mortal Life of Dherm'Gorphyek

> What follows is a historical account of the mortal life of Dherm'Gorphyek, pieced together from historical sources outside the religion.

Eons ago, Dherm'Gorphyek was born the first, and only, child of two powerful Goblin Wild Magic sourcerers. It is said he was concieved of their Wild Magic. From a very young age it was clear he would be a powerful wizard. Even as an child, he was already extremely advanced in the Illusion and Transmutation schools of magic.

It is believed by historians that he set his goals on deification at a very young age. By his early adolescence he made his skin appear to be made of Mithril to put everyone who same him in awe. He also took advantage of a local gambling epidemic to gain followers. He would find the people who gambled the most and would transmute small items they held into gold. Soon, all gamblers in the area praised him and brought him gifts. It is unknown when, but at some point he made the transition from his skin appearing to be made of Mithril to being actually made of Mithril. And before he was a full grown adult he refined his methods to gain followers, and offered more and richer boons and rewards to anyone that gambled. Even if they gambled with their life, rather than their coin. He found that people who risked the most were more likely to become obsessed with gaining his aid.

Before he was a fully-grown adult, he was deified by his followers. He had a small legion who followed his command and built him a tower from which to continue his "Great Work". The tower was surrounded by the unofficial temples of his followers: mostly taverns and inns that had gambling. But there was also a famous gladitorial arena, a school of Wild Magic, and a great panorama of brothels of all kinds.

It was not until hundreds of years later that Dherm'Gorphyek became a God in truth.
