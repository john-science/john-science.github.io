## In Character

While you are falling asleep your mind wanders. You remember being in a tavern once, a long time ago, and hearing about the Goblin god of gambling and dreams, Dherm'Gorphyek. But eveeryone just calls him The Dice Goblin. The folklore says that he finds people in their dreams twice a year, at the Summer Solstice and Winter Solstice, and he plays games of chance with them. And when those people awaken, they find they actually have the things they won in their dreams.

As you fall asleep you realize it is the <<Summer/Winter>> Solstice.

You here the faint sound of a silver bell ringing once.

...

You all find yourselves in a private room, at the back of a very familiar inn. You are sitting together around a table laid for a feast. The room is warm and dark and filled with the sounds of people in other rooms celebrating the <<Summer/Winter>> Solstice. You notice all your favorite foods and drinks are on the table, and you tuck into a lively feast.

You eat and drink together. And time paces pleasantly. Occassionally, while reaching across the table for a cup or a bowl you notice there are dice of all kinds littered around the table.

After a while of feasting and talking, you all become aware of another person sitting at the table with you. One by one you stop singing and drinking and look at the giant Goblin that has been at the table with you this whole time. His skin seems to be made of living mithril and he is at least (9 + 1d6) feet tall, and totally naked except some jewelry and a <<WINTER: white, fur-lined hat with a fuzzy ball at the end , SUMMER: green leather hat with a tropical feather stuck in a red sash>>. And there is a <<MATERIAL: see below>> bell tied to the end of his tail.

The Dice Goblin looks around the table eagerly, rubbing his hands together.

He leans forward and places <<N = number of PCs>> velvet bags on the table in front of him.


## Out of Character

<<Bring out the bags, and place them (quietly) on the table in a row.>>

Okay, if you've ever done a "Secret Santa" or "White Elephant" gift exchange, that's what this is. But you will get gifts in-game and IRL.

Most of the usual rules of DnD do not apply here, because this is a dream world. You cannot fight or cast spells. Don't try to talk to the Dice Goblin or each other. You aren't in combat, and you can't start combat in this place. But, you can win great prizes by playing the Dice Goblin's game, so don't try to break the rules just to be clever. This a dream, you just feel compelled to play the game for no reason. There are never any reasons in dreams; things just happen.

All you will need to play are a character sheet to record your winnings, and one D20. (Real, not digital.)

If you haven't done a White Elephant before, how this will work is, when I say, you will all roll one D20 at the same time. These are straight rolls, no bonuses or modifiers apply. The person with the highest roll will get to pick the first mystery bag. They will take the bag and open it in front of everyone, making sure everyone can see what they have. (Then the Dice Goblin will award that person some in-game loot, as well.)

Then the remaining <<N-1>> people will roll again. But this time, the winner has two options. They can pick an un-opened bag, or they can steal a bag that someone has already opened. (Then the Dice Goblin will award some in-game look, again.)

If someone's just had their prize stolen, they get to go again with no roll. They can steal or take un-opened bag. But they can't just re-steal what was stolen from them.

And so on, that repeats until everyone has a gift.

### Details

* Don't roll until I say, and then everyone HAS to roll at the same time, dice visible to everyone.
* A single gift can only be stolen twice, then it's locked in.
* The last person to open an un-opened bag HAS to show everyone what they won.
* If you want to freely trade gifts without stealing, wait until the game is over.


## In Character - At the End of the Game

When you wake you feel as well-rested as you ever have in your entire life. You won't even need breakfast, because it feels as if you've just had a large feast.

If you have any poison, disease, or curse effects you don't want, they are lifted.

Even though it was a dream, you each have a solid memory of what happened.

<<If one player could not make the session: their God protected them from the influences of Dherm'Gorphyek.>>


## Out of Character

Okay, make sure your character sheets are up-to-date with your in-game winnings. Your IRL winnings are yours to keep.

<br/>

<br/>

## For the Dice Goblin's Eyes Only!

* No modifiers or skills can be used on these rolls. (Things like Inspiration do not apply.)
    * The only exception is Halfling "Luck" and the Lucky Feat, those apply even in your dreams.
* If, during a roll, the highest number is a tie, the highest rollers do a roll-off until someone wins.
* Every time someone gets their first bag of IRL loot, the Dice Goblin will give two rewards:
    * One monetary reward:
        * level <=4 PCs:  (PC Level + 1d100) silver
        * level 5-15 PCs: (PC Level + 1d100) gold 
        * level >= 16s:   (PC Level + 1d100) platinum
    * One item reward:
        * Roll a D20, and give that item from the Dice Goblin Loot Table below.
        * If no one has won it yet, the last person to get an IRL loot bag shall win "DC's Hat".
        * If possible, re-roll instead of giving duplicates of items 14+.
        * For items 17-20 on the list below, describe it as "the Dice Goblin takes off his X and gives it to you".
        * Items 18 and 19 below have Summer and Winter variations.
* Some of the items below are made of a material, based on the level of the PC who recieves it:
    * <<MATERIAL>> = (PC level: <10 silver, 10-15 platinum, >15 mithril)

## Dherm'Gorphyek Diety Information

Dherm'Gorphyek is a God of Gambling and Dreams. The two often go together.

Actually, most of his worshipers aren't Goblins. And those who can't pronounce his name just call him "the Dice Goblin".

* Chaotic Neutral
* Lesser Deity
* Holy days: the Summer and Winter Solstices
* Holy symbol: None official, but unofficially two dice (one white, one green, on a silver field)
* No holy books or temples


### Joining Dherm'Gorhyek

To become an Initiate of Dherm'Gorphyek is easy; gods want followers and getting people hooked is the name of the game. DG might even come looking for you.

All you really have to do is fall asleep thinking about him, and he will visit you in your dreams. Though it will help if you gambled or did something stupidly risky that day. Or if you have spoken with one of his followers recently.

Joining is easy. But leaving the Dice Goblin would be a Hell of a risk.


### Initiate

Every follower starts out as an Initiate. 

Everything a follower learns about their faith they learn directly from Dherm'Gorphyek when he visits them in their dreams. Though he visits rarely: on holy days or to inform someone of a change to their status in the church. The more one advances in the faith, the more they speak with Dherm'Gorphyek, the more deep secrets they learn about their god and their church.

The first thing to know is that the Dice Goblin does not have holy books or temples or priests or rules. Dherm'Gorphyek does not care if you are good or evil. He does not have commandments. And he does not ask for holy wars against non-believers.

The Dice Goblin likes it when you gamble. With money or more metaphorically. He loves gladiators who risk it all in the arena. And adventurers who go off on ridiculous quests. For that reason, he also really likes people that run taverns that allow gambling, or gladitorial arenas, or brothels. Encouraging others to make risky decisions is just as good, to the Dice Goblin.

You will advance in the religion when the Dice Goblin himself decides you are living the correct life.

All Initiates are told, in their first dream with the Dice Goblin, to find an object to imbue as their Holy Symbol. As most people choose the Path of the Gambler, they pick a set of Dice or cards or a coin to toss. But Adventurers and others on the Path of the Bezerker often pick a small weapon, like a knife. Whatever you pick it must be small enough to keep on you at all times. If you lose your symbol or it is destroyed, you can re-consecrate a new one by falling asleep holding it and thinking about the Dice Goblin.


### Acolyte

The Dice Goblin is a lot more interactive than most gods. He grants boons and gives rewards. Particularly if people are watching. If you are about to roll the dice on a bet for your house, or charge into battle and certain death, shout the Dice Goblin's name for all to hear. He might just make sure you win in the showiest possible display of radiant magic. That's the sort of thing that gets a good more followers.

Once you have pleased DG enough, you will be raised to the status of Acolyte in a dream, and you will be able to choose between three paths:

* Path of the Gambler - For gifts of gold and riches. (most common)
* Path of the Bezerker - For gifts in battle.
* Path of the Sourcerer - For gifts of Wild Magic. (least common)

DG is more likely to give gifts:

* the higher your status in the religion
* If they have their Holy Symbol on them
* on the Summer and Winter Solstice 
* if you invoke his name in front of non-believers

The most important thing an Acolyte learns is that the followers that reach the rank of Chosen are invited to live forever in the afterlife created by the Dice Goblin. It is the same Dreamworld in which they have already spoken to him. It is an endless inn, with endless private rooms, each one holding a massive feast. The food and drink never runs out. There are rooms for all cultures and styles and desires. There are even arenas, for the mightiest among them to hone their skills and battle for glory throughout all eternity. There are little back rooms to cater to all desires; libraries and small rooms containing entire worlds of wilderness to explore. And for those interested, orgies.


### Disciple - WIP

The Dice Goblin isn't above earthly concerns. A discipline of Dherm'Gorphyek is likely to see the knife they are holding turn into gold at random. 

TODO

Most importantly, if a Disciple dies while taking some great risk, they will be raised to Chosen. And thus allowed to enter the great feast of the afterlife. As such, some Disciples take extravagent risks with their lives, especially those who battle or adventure already.


### Chosen - WIP

This is the goal of everyone in the religion.. The Chosen will spend eternity in the dream world afterlife set up for them by the Dice Goblin. And he will be among them, feasting and gambling and gaming and fighting.

The Chosen learn that in his mortal life Dherm'Gorphyek was worried about death, and the lack of afterlife that would follow it. So he sought deification as a way around death for himself. But he also sought a way out of Death for everyone. And so he conceieved of a way to turn his artificial Dream World into an eternal resting place for the minds of others. But he would only take those who could prove they were sure they wanted it.

It is at this point, perhaps after a lifetime of worship and sacrifice, that a member of the faith might see a loving, caring side to their god.

The Chosen are truly not frightened of death. As such, they can be truly terrifying in battle. And the Acolytes and Disciples around them that know often look on them with envy and awe.


### Zealot

Strictly speaking, there is no reason to bother ascending past Chosen. The Dice Goblin does not ask it of any of his followers. And since the religion has no priests, this is not even a ceremonial role. However, Dherm'Gorphyek sees that some of his followers are fanatical than others, so he makes a place for them. And, of course, with this greater status in the church comes more and greater material rewards from their God.

Also, true zealots of the church of the Dice God are told the full truth about their religion and their god.

Zealots are told that Dherm'Gorphyek was the name of a mortal Goblin once. That the Dice Goblin is more interested in earthly matters than most gods because he remembers being mortal (or at least tries to). He appears in the dreams of the new Zealot and shares with them the full story of his life as a mortal, leading to deification.

It is not like a god to share his faults, or be personal in any way. But perhaps Dherm'Gorphyek is expecting to spend eternity in an inn feasting and gambling with this person, and the barriers are no longer necessary.


#### The Mortal Life of Dherm'Gorphyek

> What follows is a historical account of the mortal life of Dherm'Gorphyek, pieced together from historical sources outside the religion.

Eons ago, Dherm'Gorphyek was born the first, and only, child of two powerful Goblin Wild Magic sourcerers. It is said he was concieved of their Wild Magic. From a very young age it was clear he would be a powerful wizard. Even as an child, he was already extremely advanced in the Illusion and Transmutation schools of magic.

It is believed by historians that he set his goals on deification at a very young age. By his early adolescence he made his skin appear to be made of Mithril to put everyone who same him in awe. He also took advantage of a local gambling epidemic to gain followers. He would find the people who gambled the most and would transmute small items they held into gold. Soon, all gamblers in the area praised him and brought him gifts. It is unknown when, but at some point he made the transition from his skin appearing to be made of Mithril to being actually made of Mithril. And before he was a full grown adult he refined his methods to gain followers, and offered more and richer boons and rewards to anyone that gambled. Even if they gambled with their life, rather than their coin. He found that people who risked the most were more likely to become obsessed with gaining his aid.

Before he was a fully-grown adult, he was deified by his followers. He had a small legion who followed his command and built him a tower from which to continue his "Great Work". The tower was surrounded by the unofficial temples of his followers: mostly taverns and inns that had gambling. But there was also a famous gladitorial arena, a school of Wild Magic, and a great panorama of brothels of all kinds.

It was not until hundreds of years later that Dherm'Gorphyek became a God in truth.
