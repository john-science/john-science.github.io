## Dherm'Gorphyek Deity Information

Dherm'Gorphyek is a God of Gambling and Dreams. The two often go together.

Actually, most of his worshipers aren't Goblins. And those who can't pronounce his name just call him "the Dice Goblin".

* Chaotic Neutral
* Lesser Deity
* Holy days: the Summer and Winter Solstices
* Holy symbol: None official, but unofficially two dice (one white, one green, on a silver field)
* No holy books or temples


### Joining Dherm'Gorphyek

To become an Initiate of Dherm'Gorphyek is easy; gods want followers and getting people hooked is the name of the game. He might even come looking for you.

All you really have to do is fall asleep thinking about him, and he will visit you in your dreams. Though it will help if you gambled or did something stupidly risky that day. Or if you have spoken with one of his followers recently.

Joining and leaving the religion are easy. Though the Dice Goblin will always try to entice you back, by inviting you to feast with him on the Solstices.


### Initiate

Every follower starts out as an Initiate. 

Everything a follower learns about their faith they learn directly from Dherm'Gorphyek when he visits them in the dream world. Though he visits rarely at first: on holy days or to inform someone of a change to their status in the church. The more one advances in the faith, the more they speak with Dherm'Gorphyek, the more deep secrets they learn about their god and their church.

The first thing to learn is that the Dice Goblin does not have holy books or temples or priests or rules. Dherm'Gorphyek does not care if you are good or evil. He does not have commandments. And he does not ask for holy wars against non-believers.

The Dice Goblin likes it when people gamble. With money or metaphorically. He loves gladiators who risk it all in the arena. And adventurers who go off on ridiculous quests. For that reason, he also really likes people that run taverns that allow gambling, or gladiatorial arenas, or brothels. Encouraging others to make risky decisions is just as good, to the Dice Goblin.

You will advance in the religion when the Dice Goblin himself decides you are living the correct life.

All Initiates are told, in their first dream with the Dice Goblin, to find an object to imbue as their Holy Symbol. Most people pick a set of dice or cards or a coin to toss. But adventurers and soldiers often pick a small weapon, like a knife. Whatever you pick it must be small enough to keep on you at all times. If you lose your symbol or it is destroyed, you can re-consecrate a new one by falling asleep holding it and thinking about the Dice Goblin.


### Acolyte

The Dice Goblin is a lot more interactive than most gods. He grants boons and gives rewards, particularly if people are watching. If you are about to roll the dice on a bet for your farm, or charge into battle and certain death, shout the Dice Goblin's name for all to hear. He might ensure you win in the showiest possible display of radiant magic. That's the sort of thing that gets a god more followers.

The Acolyte leans that the Dice Goblin tells each person their rank or status in the religion directly. And there is no way for anyone to truly know your rank, unless you tell them. Of course, some people lie about their rank, though the Dice Goblin hates that. Most people don't tell anyone else their rank. Which means that gatherings of followers are always awash in speculation about other people's ranks.

The most important thing an Acolyte learns is that those who reach the rank of Chosen are invited to live forever in the afterlife created by the Dice Goblin. It is the same Dreamworld in which they have already spoken to him. It is an endless inn, with endless private rooms, each one holding a massive feast. The food and drink never runs out. There are rooms for all cultures and styles and desires. There are even arenas, for the mightiest among them to hone their skills and battle for glory throughout all eternity. There are little back rooms to cater to all desires; libraries, bedrooms, orgies, and tiny rooms containing entire worlds of wilderness to explore.


#### The Paths

Each Acolyte must choose between three paths, and it is hard to switch later:

* **Path of the Gambler** - For gifts of wealth. (most common)
* **Path of the Berserker** - For gifts in battle.
* **Path of the Sorcerer** - For gifts of of magic. (least common)


### Disciple

From this rank and higher, the Dice Goblin might randomly give you aid or gifts at any time. Gifts are more likely:

* the higher their status in the religion
* if they are in possession of their Holy Symbol
* on the Summer and Winter Solstice 
* if they invoke his name in front of non-believers

<br/>

Most importantly, if a Disciple dies while taking some great risk, they will be raised to Chosen. And thus allowed to enter the great feast of the afterlife. As such, some Disciples take extravagant risks with their lives, especially those on the Path of the Berserker.

From here on, the Dice Goblin invites you to the Dream World more and more often. Disciples are allowed to wander and explore the Dream World. They can meander from room to room, meeting the people there (who may be alive or dead in the waking world). They can converse with anyone they find, free from language barriers. They will find an infinite variety of feasts, but also doors leading to private rooms, filled with little cozy bedrooms and mighty castles. There are rooms filled with wild forests and untamed mountains. There are rooms filled with the deepest, darkest mines of the Duergar, and wide open nebula homes of celestials.


#### The Paths

If in possession of their Holy Symbol: 

* **Path of the Gambler** - +1 Persuasion
* **Path of the Berserker** - +1 to Death Saving throws
* **Path of the Sorcerer** - +1 to Concentration Saving throws


### Chosen 

Obtaining the rank of Chosen is the goal of everyone in the religion. The Chosen will spend eternity in the dream world afterlife of the Dice Goblin. And he will be among them, feasting and gaming and fighting.

The Chosen learn that in his mortal life Dherm'Gorphyek was worried about death. So he sought deification as a way around death for himself. But he also sought a way out of death for everyone. And so he conceived of a way to turn his artificial Dream World into an eternal resting place for the minds of others. But he did not want to force this on anyone, so reformed the ranks of his religion. He would give everyone ample chance to understand what he was offering, and decide if they wanted it. It is at this point that a follower of the cult of Dherm'Gorphyek first sees something different in their god; a loving, caring side.

The Chosen no longer have any reason to fear death. As such, they can be truly terrifying in battle.


#### The Paths

If in possession of their Holy Symbol: 

* **Path of the Gambler** - +2 Persuasion
* **Path of the Berserker** - +2 to Death Saving throws
* **Path of the Sorcerer** - +2 to Concentration Saving throws


### Zealot

Strictly speaking, there is no reason to bother ascending past the rank of Chosen. The Dice Goblin does not ask it of his followers. No one will even know their rank. However, Dherm'Gorphyek sees that some of his followers are more fanatical than others, so he makes a place for them. And, of course, with this greater status in the church comes more and greater material rewards from their God.

Also, these zealots are told the full and complete truth about their religion and their god.

Zealots are told that Dherm'Gorphyek was the name of a mortal Goblin. The Dice Goblin is more interested in earthly matters than most gods because he remembers being mortal (or at least, he tries to). He appears in the dreams of the new Zealot and shares with them the full story of his life as a mortal, leading to deification.

It is not like a god to share his faults, or be personal in any way. But perhaps Dherm'Gorphyek is expecting to spend eternity feasting and gaming with this person, and the barriers are no longer necessary.


#### The Paths

If in possession of their Holy Symbol:

All paths receive **Confidence of the Zealot**: +1 to all Saving Throws

* **Path of the Gambler** - +2 Persuasion
    * Can cast Distort Value for free (no spell slot), once per Long Rest
* **Path of the Berserker** - +2 to Death Saving throws (stacks with Confidence of Zealotry)
    * Can cast Heroism for free (no spell slot), (minimum +1 health), once per Long Rest
* **Path of the Sorcerer** - +2 to Concentration Saving throws (stacks with Confidence of Zealotry)
    * Can cast any level 1 spell they have prepared for free (no spell slot), but they have a 50% chance to incur Wild Magic, once per Long Rest


#### The Mortal Life of Dherm'Gorphyek

> What follows is a historical account of the mortal life of Dherm'Gorphyek, pieced together from historical sources outside the religion.

Eons ago, Dherm'Gorphyek was born the first, and only, child of two powerful Goblin Wild Magic sorcerers. It is said he was conceived of their Wild Magic. Even as a child it was clear he would be a powerful wizard. Even as an child, he was already extremely advanced in the Illusion and Transmutation schools of magic.

It is believed by historians that he set his goals on deification from a very young age. By his early adolescence he made his skin appear to be made of Mithril to put everyone who same him in awe. It worked. He also took advantage of a local gambling epidemic to gain followers. He would find the people who gambled the most and would transmute small items they held into gold. Soon, all gamblers in the area praised him and brought him gifts. It is believed his father died before he was born and his mother died of Wild Magic before he was fully grown.

It is unknown when, but at some point in his adolescence he made the transition from his skin appearing to be Mithril to being actually made of living Mithril. He refined his methods to gain followers, and offered more and richer boons and rewards to anyone that gambled. He even started supporting those who gambled with their life, rather than their coin. He found that people who risked the most were more likely to become obsessed with gaining his aid.

Before he was fully grown, he was deified by his followers. A couple of small city states fell to his new religion, and he quickly became commander of some of the most feared warriors the world had ever seen. But he did not attempt to expand his territory. His cities became centers of commerce, and enticed people to them with stories of dens for every vice imaginable. There was gambling, of course. But also a famous gladiatorial arena, a grand school of Wild Magic, and a great panorama of brothels of all kinds.

He followers built him a heavily-fortified tower, so he could continue his work. It was not until hundreds of years later that Dherm'Gorphyek became a God in truth.
