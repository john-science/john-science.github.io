I love text-based games. They come from different places than most games:

Modern games need giant teams and multi-million dollar budgets. They need a 3D art department, a music team, advertising, accounting, HR, you name it. Which is all fine, but how can a single creative vision survive such a process?  The games I have loved the most have come from a very small team; one or maybe a dozen people. They had real creative control and did something unique and interesting.

Also, if I am being totally honest, I covet the idea that one day I could write a decent text-based game. No corporate backing; just me and a laptop. It is <small>(theoretically)</small> possible that I could create some little game that a few people would love. You know, maybe. One day. A boy can dream.

Below are some of my favorite text-based games. All of these games have legions of fans. They all did something original, or fascinating, or fun, and people love them.

**And all these games are free to play, right now!**
