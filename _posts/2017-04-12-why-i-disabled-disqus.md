summary: Why I removed the Disqus comments from my blog.

{% include JB/setup %}

This is a small, personal blog. It does not have a wide readership and it does not generate me any revenue.

Originally, I thought the Disqus comments were a fun, free feature to add to my blog. But at what cost to my (admittedly few) readers?  Disqus offers a free service, and I have no comments about its quality. But the saying goes:

> If you're not paying for the product, you are the product.

Some how, some way, Disqus is using the traffic on my little website for marketing. That means at some point my reader's privacy will have monetary value.  In an increasingly tracked world, I do not want to be part of the problem.

I am [not the first person](http://chrislema.com/killed-disqus-commenting/) to disconnect my Disqus comments. If it were a feature that were really valuable to me, I would find a paid service that would gaurantee my user's privacy. So far, I have not even started looking.

The only concern I have left is that I still have Google Analytics on my site...
