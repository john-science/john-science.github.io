The BBC is teaming up with the folks over at [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchpresents) to give us an entire summer of Classic Doctor Who!

This should be *hilarious*.

Starting on March 29th with the first ever episode of Doctor Who and ending on July 23rd with the last episode of Classic Who, this will be a great summer. The episodes are aired in Chronological order and cover most of the Classic Who stories. Though there are some exceptions and, of course, a lot of episodes have been lost forever.

But over 100 stories, over 500 episodes, of Classic Who will be free to watch! And, you know, legally.

**Pro Tip**: a lot of these episodes will be perfect for a Bad Movie Night. Invite your friends over, and don't take anything seriously.

Anyway, you can watch them all [here on Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchpresents), and you can find the calendar of events [here](https://www.doctorwho.tv/watch/twitch/#US).
