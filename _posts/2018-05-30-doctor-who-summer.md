The BBC is teaming up with the folks over at **[twitch.tv](https://www.doctorwho.tv/watch/twitch/)** to give us an entire summer of Classic Doctor Who!

This should be *hilarious*.

They are playing most of Classic Who (pre-1990) in Chronological order. Starting on March 29th with the first-ever episode of Doctor Who and ending on July 23rd with the last episode of the Classic Who era. Over 100 stories, over 500 episodes, of Classic Who will be free to watch!

Anyway, you can watch them all on **[twitch.tv](https://www.doctorwho.tv/watch/twitch/)**.

**Pro Tip**: A lot of these episodes will be perfect for a Bad Movie Night. Invite your friends over, and don't take anything seriously.
