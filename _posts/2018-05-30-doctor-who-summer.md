{% include JB/setup %}

The BBC is teaming up with the folks over at **[twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchpresents)** to give us an entire summer of Classic Doctor Who!

This should be *hilarious*.

The series kicks off on March 29th with the first-ever episode of Doctor Who and ends on July 23rd with the last episode of the Classic Who era. The episodes are aired in Chronological order and cover most of the Classic Who stories. Most days air three different stories (2-4 epsiodes each), and repeat them all three times every day.

Over 100 stories, over 500 episodes, of Classic Who will be free to watch! And, you know, legally.

Anyway, you can watch them all on **[twitch.tv](https://www.doctorwho.tv/watch/twitch/#US)**.

**Pro Tip**: a lot of these episodes will be perfect for a Bad Movie Night. Invite your friends over, and don't take anything seriously.
