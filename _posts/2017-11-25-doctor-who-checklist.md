Have you ever decided to wade into the Doctor Who back-catalogue only to get lost?

It is easy to get lost in 50 years of canon. To that end, I built a handy checklist. It will help you track which episodes you have seen, which you haven't, and how many hours of unique episodes you have left.

## [Here is the Checklist](/apps/dw.html).

# How much Who is out there?

Doctor Who has always been broken into "stories". Sometimes a single episode is a stand-alone story. But sometimes, particularly in the old days, many episodes in a row are part of a single, tightly-bound "story".

#### Episodes Since 1963
* **[275](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_overview)** TV stories have aired.
* Watching all of those would take: **17 days, 1 hour and 55 minutes**.

#### Classic Who
* **[155](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#First_Doctor)** stories aired between 1964 and 1989.
* Watching these would take: **12 days, 4 hours, and 50 minutes**.

#### Nu Who
* **[119](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Ninth_Doctor)** stories have aired since the 2005 reboot.
* Watching these would take: **4 days, 19 hours, and 40 minutes**.
