I want to re-watch all of the Doctor Who TV episodes with River Song, but from her timeline. Deciphering the order took a bit of research, so I thought I'd share my results.

### Huge Story Arc

The River Song story arc is pretty big:

* **River meets 3 Doctors** (that we know of)
* **River is in 15 episodes**
* **Total run time above: 12 hours**

### Post Mortem

The first three episodes in the above list actully have River at multiple points in her own time line. So it doesn't *feel* like you're walking through her life with her, exactly. But after those first few, everything becomes a lot more linear. River Song really has great chemistry with Matt Smith's Doctor, so the first three-quarters of the Timeline is really pretty great. Round about the `The Husbands of River Song` episode, things start to get pretty sad. No spoilers, but the last quarter of the episodes on the Timeline had a lot more feels for me when I watched them from her perspective. Having watched them all again, I think I might remove the last episode from the list. It doesn't really fit.
