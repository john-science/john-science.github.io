I want to re-watch all of the Doctor Who TV episodes with River Song, but from her timeline. Pulling this together took a bit of research, so I thought I'd share the results.

### River Song's Timeline - by Episode

Beware: the first three episodes have River Song at multiple points in her timeline. So it doesn't *feel* like you are following her timeline, exaclty. But after those those, it becomes much more linear.

### Huge Story Arc

The River Song story arc is pretty big:

* **River meets 3 Doctors** (that we know of)
* **River is in 15 episodes**
* **Total run time above: 12 hours**
