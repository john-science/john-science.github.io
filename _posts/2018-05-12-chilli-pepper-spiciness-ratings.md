I love spicy foods and some peppers are amazingly tasty. BUT before throwing a few peppers into a dish I'm cooking I want to know roughly how spicy it is.  (I usually compare everything to jalapeno and habanero peppers, as my calibration points.)  The spiciest pepper isn't the tastiest though, so I just ignore the top few peppers on this list for any kind of real cooking.
