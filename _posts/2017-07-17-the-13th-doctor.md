The BBC has [announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1IczjLYCIM) that [Jodie Whittaker](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2092886/) will be the actor to play the next Doctor on [Doctor Who](http://antineutrino.net/tags.html#Doctor%20Who-ref).

Fans can talk about little else.


## Who?

If you are a Whovian who has never heard of Whittaker, you have never watched [Broadchurch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249364/). Whittaker is a main character in all three seasons of the incredibly successful British crime drama. The show is pretty somber, dealing with the fallout in families affected by child murder. Whittaker's performance in Broadchurch is top-notch, and there is no doubt she is good at her craft. In the show, she actually works alongside [David Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant) and [David Bradley](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0103195/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t38) who have each played the Doctor.

Whittaker has done a lot of other stuff too. But the nerd core knows her best for her part in [Attack the Block](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1478964/): the 2011 indie sci-fi movie where aliens invade a South London neighborhood and end up in a war with the local gang. The movie is action and sci-fi with a fun, light tone that might be good practice for an aspiring Doctor Who actor.

It is interesting to note that the new Doctor Who show runner, [Chris Chibnall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chibnall), also ran Broadchurch. Which means he chose an actress he is already worked with. Maybe knowing the right people helps, or maybe he just knows that he can get the performance he wants out of Whittaker. Though it sounds like she just [crushed the audition](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/16/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-announced-13th-doctor).


## When?

The 13th Doctor's [first episode](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6968542/) will be the 2017 Christmas special. That means fans will have to wait five-and-a-half months to see Whittaker as the Doctor. But even then, it is a good guess that Capaldi will remain the Doctor for most of that episode. In reality, it will be a year or two before Whittaker really takes the reigns.

Brace yourself for a long wait.
