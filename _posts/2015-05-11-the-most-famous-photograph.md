What is fame?

I am not talking about the *best* photograph in the world. It is hard to measure that. So this is all about numbers. In this case, the most *famous* photograph in the world is the one that has seen by the most people.

So, what photograph is that?

This was the default Windows XP background. And by virtue of that alone at least a billion people have seen it [[citation needed]](https://xkcd.com/285/). In fact, as late as July, 2013, [25 percent](http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-long-before-microsoft-windows-xp-disappears/) of all the desktop computers on the planet still ran Windows XP.

As luck would have it, I used to live a short 15-minute drive away from the place in Sonoma where this photograph was taken. And when I got my first camera I would stop by that sunny little spot on the side of the road and try to recreate this photograph. My first attempts were uninspiring:

As a beginner in any field it is easy to see the work of masters and not see the skill involved. I was pretty disheartened. After all, I had a camera and was standing on the same spot, looking at the same hill, why shouldn't I be able to make a decent picture? It turns out the original photograph was taken by [Charles O'Rear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_O%27Rear), who used to work for National Geographic; which might just be the hardest job to get in photography.

These days, Charles has the [enviable life](http://framework.latimes.com/2014/05/30/charles-orears-road-to-bliss/#/0) of travelling around the world and photographing various wine regions. In fact, he was doing just that when he stopped by the side of the road one day and took this picture; he was living in Napa and working on a photo book of the wine country. Perhaps that is just the kind of freedom one gets after a lifetime of such [success](http://www.cnet.com/au/news/its-bliss-behind-the-iconic-windows-xp-photo/).

I have since moved away from Sonoma and the wine county (more's the pity). Some days I think of going back and making a better image of it "knowing what I know now". But the truth is, even before I left the hill had been covered with grape vines, and then a road was build across it:

It is the sign of a master that Charles was able to point a camera at all the noise in the natural world and have the result look so simple. In fact, the image was so perfect, I (like [a lot of other people](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/11/charles_o_rear_is_the_photographer_who_took_the_windows_xp_wallpaper_photo.html)) originally thought it was computer graphics. But it's just the product of an organized mind.

I was originally only interested in [Bliss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_%28image%29) because it was a little piece of local color. But if you're ever in Sonoma, you can go take a look at it for yourself. And when you're done, not 200 feet away, you can go to the [Fremont Diner](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fremont-diner-sonoma). That is my favourite restaurant anywhere. It's just a diner, but baked into every bisquit is Napa's modern sensibilities about food. If you're planning your day, I think both the hill and diner are best at breakfast.
