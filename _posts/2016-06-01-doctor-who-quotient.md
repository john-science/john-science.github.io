How big a fan of the show are you? And I don't want some timey-wimey answer. I want a number.

### The Doctor Who Quotient

Your Doctor Who Quotient (`Q`) is the fraction of complete stories you have seen:

    Q = (# stories you've seen) / 263

#### Try the [Q Calculator](/apps/q.html).

### What is a Story?

Doctor Who has always been broken into "stories". Sometimes a single episode is a stand-alone story. But sometimes, particularly in the old days, four episodes in a row are part of a single, tightly-bound "story". These are how we measure your knowledge of the Doctor.

* [263](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Series_overview) TV stories have aired, so far
* [155](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#First_Doctor) stories aired between 1964 and 1989
* [26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_missing_episodes) of the original 155 stories are at least partially lost
* [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_%28film%29) made-for-TV movie was made in 1996
* [107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Ninth_Doctor) stories have aired since the 2005 reboot

### What's Your Quotient?

If you are a serious Nu-Whovian, and have been watching since 2005, your `Q` could be as high as:

{% highlight python %}
Q = 107 / 263 = 0.4  (serious fan)
{% endhighlight %}

A classic Whovian, who watched religiously from 1964 to 1989, might have a `Q` as high as:

{% highlight python %}
Q = 155 / 263 = 0.59  (addict)
{% endhighlight %}

If you started watching Doctor Who today and got totally obsessed, you could watch all the stories except the lost 26. This could put your `Q` as high as:

{% highlight python %}
Q = (263 - 26) / 263 = 0.9  (wildly insane)
{% endhighlight %}
