## What is Technical Debt?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt):

> "Technical Debt is the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. Analogous with monetary debt, if technical debt is not repaid, it can accumulate "interest", making it harder to implement changes."

If we write bad code, we have to spend more time on the code later, and that's the debt. If we don't pay these debts, they grow over time until we are bankrupt. In software, "bankruptcy" is when it is so difficult to change the code that people spend more time fixing things than building new features.

> In this sense, "bad code" is code that requires us to revisit it later, because of its low quality or inapplicability to the solution.

The analogy to financial debt is good. Obviously, too much debt is ruinous. But some debt is good. You might take out a loan to buy a house. And that home loan might be part part of a larger financial plan that leads, eventually, to financial independence.


### Where does the analogy with real debt break down?

> 1. If you take out a loan, there is someone who lends us the money.

Unfortunately, in software, there is no banker reminding you to pay your debts on a regular schedule. It is easy for a software project to get in the situation where no one is tracking the technical debt. If large chunks of debt are temporarily forgotten, the interest can accrue unchecked.

It is quite common for us to be far less efficient than a bank at demanding the debts be paid. Certainly, we aren't going to hire collection agencies to harass ourselves. Without progressively agressive demands for repayment, the interest can grow unrestrained in software in a way it would hardly ever in finance.

> 2. If you owe money, your repayments are usually easy to track.

You usually pay back a financial debt based on a timed schedule. But for technical debt, your repayments are driven by urgency and utility.

If I write bad code today, I might be ashamed of myself. But if that code is in a part of the codebase that hardly ever changes, then I might not run into any big problems with that shoddy code for a long time. Whereas if that code is in a really fast-moving, highly active part of the code, I will immediately start incurring high interest on that debt.

So deciding what technical debts need to be paid first can be quite subtle. You need to analyze the current state of the code, find the weaknesses that might lead to bugs, and understand the future goals of the codebase. All of this is at the intersection of software architecture and project management.


## What causes technical debt?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt) has a big list.

But let's look at four of the top problems:

1. **[Bit Rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot)** - as new features are added, the old code is no longer optimal
2. **Lack of Design**
4. **Lack of Testing**
3. **Buisness Pressures** - "Do it now."


### How do we deal with it?

So, how do we deal with the above four problems?

To fight **Bit Rot**, it is important to build into the culture the idea that software is never "finished". Software IS constant maintanence. Software is like a garden that might be beautiful or productive, but only if it is tended regularly. The definition of a quality in a codebase is when making small, regular changes is cheap.

To fight **Lack of Design**, it is important to start with a solid design for the code. You want to avoid the [big ball of mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern#Big_ball_of_mud) code base, sure. But it is just as important that the team working on the software keeps that design in mind throughout the lifetime of the code. You can do this via documentation; by keeping a "tourist map to the codebase" up to date at all times. But it is more imporant that it is in the zeitgeist, and part of the tribal knowledge of the entire team.

Fighting **Lack of Testing** is the easiest of the four. Build some tests, and run them under automated [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration). All codebases need good code coverage with [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), but they also need [integration tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing) and [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing).

Fighting **Buisness Pressure** is often the hardest. It means having developers that understand good design, managers that understand technical debt, and frequent, open communication between the two. This is where the analogy to financial debt really shines. In finance, how do we avoid falling into debt? We invest. We invest in skills and our careers, but we also invest financially. But we can't invest 100% of our money, we need some money to live on today. Engineering, like finance, is the careful assessment of cost-benefit analysis.


### Straw Men Fighting

> Hopefully, everyone on your team is an adult. But usually when we talk about the Technical Debt, we talk about Two Straw Men Fighting.

(Why are they "men", you ask? Because they're fighting.)

One straw man is a software developer, who knows that if we take short cuts today, he will be stuck with code that is harder to support tomorrow. He will spend long, thankless hours bug-hunting and trying to fit new features in a system that isn't flexible enough. The technical debt is his to pay of. And paying it will make people will think he's slow at his job.

The other straw man is a manager on the software project, who has deadlines to meet, and don't care about the nerd warefare of "doing it right". It just needs to get done.

These two straw men fight back and forth forever, constantly at odds. Each trying to get what they need. One worried about this week's deadlines, the other worried about the medium-term life of the project.

Of course, in reality, this is only a fight if one of these people doesn't understand the cost-benefit analysis of technical debt. If everyone on the project understands the software, and the idea of technical debt, they can make good medium-term plans for the project work.
