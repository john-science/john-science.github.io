summary: The entire history of the Dwarves of Middle Earth.

{% include JB/setup %}

I recently took a deep dive into the history of Tolkien's Dwarves for a [game](https://github.com/theJollySin/mazes_of_erebor) I am writing. There is not as much known about the Dwarves as there is about the Elves, who were given entire books for their history. So, I had to scrounge information from all of Tolkien's works.

What follows is the Cliff's Notes version of every major event in Dwarven history, that we know of. Tolkien's mythology evolved and improved over time; where possible I try to use the last and most recent version. Text in italics is not explicitly stated in Tolkien's works, but can be inferred without too much imagination.

 &nbsp;

### Before the Dwarves

Much happens before the Dwarves are awakened that shapes their world.

+ [Eru Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar) creates the gods* [Ainur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainur_%28Middle-earth%29), with [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB) and [Melkor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgoth) among them. <sub>1</sub>
+ Melkor is the greatest of the Ainur, but is overwhelmed by a desire for power. <sub>1</sub>
+ [Arda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_%28Tolkien%29), the physical world, is created. <sub>1</sub>
+ Some Ainur descend into Arda to oversee it; they are known as the [Valar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vala_%28Middle-earth%29). <sub>1</sub>
+ Melkor claims Arda for himself, and so becomes the source of all evil. <sub>2</sub>
+ Aulë, god* of skill and craftsmanship, creates the Dwarves in secret from the other Valar. <sub>2 9</sub>
+ Ilúvatar finds out about the Dwarves, and tells Aulë to destroy them. But Ilúvatar stops Aulë at the last moment and allows the Dwarves to exist, stipulating only that they must go to sleep until after the Elves awake. <sub>9</sub>
+ [YT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Arda#Years_of_the_Trees) 1050: Elves are awakened by [Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar). <sub>8</sub>
+ [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) is originally a [Maia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maia_%28Middle-earth%29), or demigod servant, to [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB); but he is corrupted and becomes the chief lieutenant of [Melkor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgoth). <sub>2</sub>
+ Melkor begins breeding [Orcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc_%28Middle-earth%29). <sub>9</sub>

<sub>*In the Valquenta, Tolkien writes of the Valar: "Men often called them Gods", but he does not say what the Dwarves called them.</sub>

 &nbsp;

### First Age

The First Age is counted by Elves as starting before Eru awoke the Dwarves. But Dwarven history starts here, before the Sun and Moon exist.

+ The seven [Fathers of Dwarves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fathers_of_the_Dwarves) are first awakened by [Ilúvatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eru_Il%C3%BAvatar), as are the first [Ents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ent). <sub>9</sub>
+ [Durin the Deathless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_the_Deathless) awakes alone, first of all Dwarves, in [Mount Gundabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Mount_Gundabad) in the [Misty Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Mountains), and it was forever after sacred to the Dwarves.
+ Two Fathers awoke in the Blue Mountains, and there they founded the clans of the [Broadbeams](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Broadbeams) and the [Firebeards](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Firebeards) who later lived in [Nogrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Nogrod) and [Belegost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Beleriand#Belegost) respectively.
+ The four other Fathers awoke in the far East. We know the least about these Dwarves, except that they arose in the [Orocarni](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Orocarni) Mountains and formed the four clans [Ironfists](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ironfists), [Stiffbeards](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stiffbeards), [Blacklocks](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Blacklocks), and [Stonefoots](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Stonefoots).
+ Durin sees a reflection of himself wearing a crown in the lake [Kheled-zâram](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Mirrormere) and then founds [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29) in the caves behind it. Dwarves begin to gather there and form the composite [Longbeards](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin's_Folk) clan.
+ [YT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Arda#Years_of_the_Trees) 1250: The Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost are met by the [Sindarian Elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindar), etablishing trade.
+ The Dwarves are the first to forge mail armor of linked rings. *Tolkien's works rarely involve plate armor.*
+ YT 1300: The Dwarves of Belegost and the Sindarian Elves begin building the great underground Elven city of [Doriath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doriath).
+ The Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost build the great [Dwarf-road](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarf-road_of_Beleriand) to [trade](http://www.henneth-annun.net/events_view.cfm?evid=994) with the Elves of Doriath and Beleriand.
+ YT 1497: Dwarves join the Sindarian and Green Elves in the [First Battle of Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Battle_of_Beleriand) is the first of the [Wars of Beleriand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#Battles_of_Beleriand) against Melkor.
+ -1: The moon rises for the first time.
+ 0: The sun rises for the first time.  (YT 1500)
+ 0: Humans are awakened by Ilúvatar in [Hildórien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Arda#Hild.C3.B3rien).
+ c 60–200: Melkor persuades humans to stop worshipping Ilúvatar and turn to evil, but some revolt: the Atanatári. Dwarves and the Avari Elves aid these humans in travelling West in search of the Valar. As divine punishment, humans lose the ability to die at will and are doomed to lead short lives at the end of which death takes them by force.
+ The great Dwarven smith [Telchor](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Telchar) of Nogrod crafts many works, including the famous blades [Narsil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Narsil) and [Angrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Angrist) and the [Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Dragon-helm_of_Dor-l.C3.B3min).
+ 468: The Dwarves of Belegost join the [Union of Meahdros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maedhros) in [Nírnaeth Arnoediad](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Nirnaeth_Arnoediad), the fifth battle of the Wars of Beleriand against Melkor. King [Azaghâl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Azagh.C3.A2l) was slain by [Glaurung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaurung), the first dragon, but not before he stabbed the beast in the stomach making it flee the battle.  (*Since Dwarves were in the first and fifth wars of Beleriand, they were probably in the others.*)
+ 502: King [Thingol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thingol) of Doriath invites the Dwarves of Norgrod to create jewelery in his vast treasury; of these works the necklace [Nauglamír](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_objects#Nauglam.C3.ADr) is their finest.
+ 503: King Thingol has Dwarves set the [Silmaril](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Silmaril) of [Beren](http://lotr.wikia.com/wik/Beren) and [Lúthien](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/L%C3%BAthien) into Nauglamír, making it the fairest object in Arda. The Dwarven jewelers so desire it, then end up slaying Thingol. They lie about what happened to the Dwarves on Norgrond and return with an army to sack Doriath. Heavy with spoils on their march home from Doriath, the Dwarven army is destroyed entirely by Elves and Ents in the [Battle of Sarn Athrad](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Battle_of_Sarn_Athrad).
+ 545-587: [The War of Wrath](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/War_of_Wrath) between the Valar; after which the world West of the [Blue Mountains](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Blue_Mountains) is sunk into the sea. Melkor is captured. Two great houses of Dwarves, Nogrod and Belegost, are destroyed; the survivors flee to Khazad-dûm. It is also believed that the original mansions of the four Eastern clans are destroyed in this war.
+ 590: Melkor is cast into the void.

 &nbsp;

### Second Age

The second age lasts 3441 years, during which little is written about the history of Dwarves.

+ c 750-1500: The two greatest craftsman of the age, [Celebrimbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrimbor) (the Elven Lord of Eregion) and the Dwarf [Narvi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Narvi), build the [Doors of Durin](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Doors_of_Durin): the West gate of [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29). The gate was designed to aid the friendship between Dwarves and Elves.
+ c 1500-1590: [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) gives [seven rings of power](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Seven_Rings) to seven Dwarf Kings. (*It is likely that a ring is given to the leader of each of the seven [Dwarven clans](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves#Origin). But these rings are not able to corrupt their Dwarven bearers. Later in the Second Age, four of these rings are destroyed by Dragons, and Sauron retrieves two more.*)
+ 1697: Sauron corrupts [Eregion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eregion), the vast region including that above Khazad-dûm, and drives out all the [Sindarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin) Elves. The Doors of Durin are shut, and the Dwarves there begin a long seclusion from the outside world.
+ 3430: [Durin IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_IV) adds a great Dwarven army to the [Last Alliance of Elves and Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Last_Alliance), in the fight against Sauron.
+ 3434: The Last Alliance defeats Sauron's forces in the [Battle of Dagorlad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Last_Alliance); and the Siege of [Barad-dûr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barad-d%C3%BBr) begins.
* 3441: [Isildur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isildur) cuts the [One Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring) from Sauron's finger with the shattered hilt of the sword [Narsil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Narsil), ending the war. <sub>14</sub>

 &nbsp;

### Third Age

The third age lasts 3021 years, and during this time the number of Dwarves begins to decline.

+ 1980: Dwarven [mithril](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithril) miners in [Khazad-dûm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29) delve too greedily and too deep and awaken a [Balrog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balrog) which kills [King Durin VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durin#Durin_VI), and ever after the Dwarves call it [Durin's Bane](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin's_Bane).
+ 1981: Durin VI's son, [Náin I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#N.C3.A1in_I) is killed by the Durin's Bane, and Dwarves abandon Khazad-dûm; they start calling it Moria, meaning "Black Pit".
+ 1999: After fleeing Khazad-dûm, [Thráin I](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_I) founds [Erebor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lonely_Mountain) and discovers the [Arkenstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_objects#Arkenstone) underneathe it.
+ 2210: King Thorin I [leaves Erebor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Third_Age_2210), and goes north to the [Grey Mountains](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Grey_Mountains), where the remnants of Durin's Folk are gathering.
+ 2570-2589: [The War of the Dwarves and Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Dragons) in the [Grey Mountains](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Grey_Mountains). The Dwarves lose and the survivors flee to resettle in Erebor and the Iron Hills.
+ 2770: The fire drake [Smaug the Golden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smaug) takes Erebor, killing many.
+ c 2780-2790: After fleeing Smaug, the Longbeards temporarily settle in the human town of [Dunland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Dunland), in the foothills of the [Misty Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_Mountains).
+ 2790: King-in-Exile [Thrór](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Thr.C3.B3r) leaves Dunland and enters Moria alone. Azog the Orc kills him, defiles the body, and claims Moria for the Orcs.
+ 2790: [Nár](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/N%C3%A1r), servant of Thrór, brings word of Thrór's death back to [Thráin II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thr%C3%A1in_II), his son. Thráin II does not eat or sleep for seven days, then declares war on the Orcs.
+ 2790-2793: For the first time, all seven clans of Dwarves gather; to wage war on the Orcs.
+ 2793-2799: [The War of Dwarves and Orcs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Orcs) starts at [Mount Gundbad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Mount_Gundabad) in the North of the Misty Mountains and the Dwarves clear out every Orc stronghold to [Methedras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Methedras) in the South.
+ 2799: The war ends at the Eastern gate of Moria with the [Battle of Azanulbizar](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Battle_of_Azanulbizar). In this battle that Thorin II, son King Thráin II, gains the epithet "Oakenshield". Every Orc is slain, but the Dwarves suffer huge losses. Instead of the usual stone tombs, the dead are burned in a great pyre and their decendants are honored as "the sons of burned Dwarves". After the battle, Dwarves see the Balrog in the gates of Moria, and turn back. They do not retake Moria.  (*Without this underground war, there would have been many more orcs in the Misty Mountains during the [War of the Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Ring), and it would have been much harder to win. This war also accounts for why Dwarven numbers were already so small by the time of the War of the Ring.*)
+ 2845: Thráin II was captured by [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron)'s forces and in the dungeons of [Dol Guldur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dol_Guldur) and the last of the seven rings was taken back. <sub>4</sub>
+ 2850: [Gandalf the Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf) finds Thráin II in Dol Guldur, insane after years of torture. Thráin gives Gandalf a map and a key to Erebor and asks Gandalf to give them to his son, though Gandalf does not yet know who Thráin is. <sub>4</sub>
+ 2941: Thorin Oakenshield begins the [Quest of Erebor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quest_of_Erebor) with his close relations: [Balin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balin_%28Middle-earth%29), [Fíli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#F.C3.ADli), [Kíli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#K.C3.ADli), [Glóin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gl%C3%B3in), [Óin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/%C3%93in), [Dwalin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Dwalin), [Dori](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Dori), [Nori](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Nori), [Ori](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Ori), [Bifur](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Bifur), [Bofur](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Bofur), and [Bombur](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Bombur).

+ 2941: Thorin, Fíli, and Kíli are killed in [The Battle of the Five Armies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_wars_and_battles#Battle_of_Five_Armies) along with Bolg son of Azog, and many Orcs, Dwarves, Elves, and Humans. Dáin II Ironfoot becomes King of The Lonely Mountain and recieves the Arkenstone. The town of Dale, just outside of Erebor, is re-established by Bard. <sub>4 13</sub>
+ 2989: Balin takes a company of Dwarves to recolonize Moria. They succeed for a time, and even find [Durin's Axe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Durin.27s_Axe).
+ 2994: King Balin is killed by an Orc arrow outside Moria in the [Dimrill Dale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth_%28fictional%29#Dimrill_Dale). His tome is built in his throne room; the [Chamber of Mazarbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_%28Middle-earth%29#Chamber_of_Mazarbul).

 &nbsp;

### Fourth Age

Tolkien does not tell us much about the Fourth Age or beyond.

+ c 1-100: The Dwarves of [Erebor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Mountain), [Gimli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimli_%28Middle-earth%29) in particular, rebulid and greatly improve the Human city of [Minas Tirith](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Minas_Tirith).
+ c 20-120: Gimli returns to [Aglarond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm's_Deep#Aglarond) and founds a Dwarf colony there, where he is known as [Lord of the Glittering Caves](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lord_of_the_Glittering_Caves). 
+ 120: [It is believed](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves#Fourth_Age) that Gimli, son of [Glóin](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Gl%C3%B3in), becomes the only Dwarf ever to cross the sea to the [Undying Lands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aman_%28Tolkien%29).
+ [Durin VII](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Durin_VII) (Durin the Last) leads Durin's Folk back to [Khazad-dûm](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Moria) and restores the greatest kingdom of the Dwarves.
+ Khazad-dûm and Erebor are the two great final kingdoms of the Dwarves. <sub>citation needed</sub>
+ It is not clear if the Dwarves slowly diminish and are gone from the world or if they simply delve so deeply that they are never seen above ground again. <sub>citation needed</sub>

 &nbsp;

#### Nature of Dwarves

+ The average Dwarf is shorter than the average Human or Elf. <sub>citation needed</sub>
+ The Dwarves were "stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship and enmity, and they suffer toil and hunger and hurt of body more heartily than other speaking peoples". <sub>9</sub>
+ Both male and female Dwarves are  born with full beards. <sub>3</sub>
+ By the Second and Third Age Dwarves naturally live about 250 solar years <sub>4</sub>.
+ The Dwarves are secretive about their religion. *But it probably revolves around [Aulë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aul%C3%AB).* <sub>9</sub>
+ The Dwarves are secretive about their language, Khudzul; which was given to them by Aulë. <sub>9</sub> (They do not speak Khudzul in front of non-Dwarves and only two outsiders ever learned to speak it: the elves [Eöl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E%C3%B6l) and [Curufin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curufin). Through intensive effort, Khudzul remained unchanged throughout all four ages.) <sub>5</sub>
